District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I believe that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, far too long to thing about, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Ridglan has shown that they have no compassion or care for other living beings, while the rescuers have shown just that and more. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. Go with compassion.


Respectfully,


Blake Frino-Gerl
