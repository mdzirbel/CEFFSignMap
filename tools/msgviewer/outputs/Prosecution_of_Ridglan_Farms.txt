District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   • Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or   veterinarians present
  *   • Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   • Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


How can we as living beings not humanely coexist with other species of our planet? How do we constantly allow the power of a dollar to control our actions and turn a blind eye to undeniably cruel and torturous acts?





We as citizens of your community trust you as our elected officials to protect and defend our people and animals. Please take action against these criminal acts.


Respectfully,

Nancy Kaur
