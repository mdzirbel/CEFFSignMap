District Attorney Ozanne,

By now you must be more than aware of the atrocities allowed at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. As the supposedly intelligent species, it is our duty to ensure we are the voices of those who cannot speak for themselves. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


It doesnâ€™t take much to DO THE RIGHT THING. Your consideration to respond is appreciated.
