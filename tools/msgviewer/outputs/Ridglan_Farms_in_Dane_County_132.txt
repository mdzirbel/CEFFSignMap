﻿ Hello,

 I have grave concerns that criminal animal abuse is being ignored in Dane County, specifically at Ridglan Farms, a dog breeder.  Your office has prosecuted the rescuers of beagles from horrific conditions but has done nothing about the abuse taking place at Ridglan Farms itself.

 It’s a breeder of beagles sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.

Ridglan Farms deserves an investigation.

Thank you for looking into this.
