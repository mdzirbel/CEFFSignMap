Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

Criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. During many decades, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

I understand that instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms!

Respectfully,

Doris Potter
