District Attorney Ozanne,



Please stop the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. This company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments for many years. Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws by surgical mutilating dogs without anesthetics or veterinarians present; confining them to small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs; and using improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.



Please stop prosecuting the rescuers of these dogs and instead prosecute the true criminals here. Please do not support cruelty to animals by allowing thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.



Sincerely,

Erin O'Brien
