District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

as a sidenote, I’m just racking my head as to how anybody can turn a blind eye to mutilating an animal with without anesthesia first, while you don’t need to have animal experiments anymore in order to create drugs but even if you do, there are ways to go about it that aren’t suffering. Most of us have a dog or know somebody who does can you imagine doing this to your pet?

It’s pretty awful. You have the power to do something about it
