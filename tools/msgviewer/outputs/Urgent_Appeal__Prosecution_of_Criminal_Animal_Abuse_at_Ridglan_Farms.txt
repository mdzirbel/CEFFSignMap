Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am reaching out to you with deep concerns regarding the ongoing issue of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It has come to my attention that the company has been perpetrating egregious acts of cruelty against animals for many decades, particularly in the context of breeding dogs for brutal experiments.

Despite numerous instances of Ridglan Farms violating state animal cruelty laws, including but not limited to:

  *   Performing surgical mutilations on animals without the presence of anesthetics or qualified veterinarians.
  *   Subjecting animals to confinement in cramped metal cages, often in solitary conditions, resulting in severe psychological trauma.
  *   Maintaining inadequate flooring and housing conditions, leading to debilitating foot injuries and infections, especially among vulnerable puppies.

Instead of pursuing legal action against Ridglan Farms for these blatant offenses, it has come to my attention that your office has chosen to prosecute individuals attempting to rescue these innocent animals. This deeply troubling approach fails to uphold justice and allows thousands of dogs within your jurisdiction to continue suffering from criminal abuse.

I implore you to reconsider your course of action and take decisive steps to hold Ridglan Farms accountable for their reprehensible actions. It is imperative that the perpetrators of such heinous acts face the full extent of the law, rather than those who are working tirelessly to protect and save these animals from further harm.

Please, let justice prevail, and prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms for their egregious violations of animal welfare laws.

Respectfully,
Shreshtha Jain
