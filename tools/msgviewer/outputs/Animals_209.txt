Please address the horrific animal abuse at Ridglan farms. Dogs are driven insane being confined in small cages. Their paws are painful due to standing on wire. The dogs eyes are burning from urine and feces fumes! Stop this horrible torture of animals. Stand up for whatâ€™s morally and ethically just! Animals are sentient beings who suffer egregiously in cages and laboratories!!
