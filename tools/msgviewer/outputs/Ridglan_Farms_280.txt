Dear District Attorney Coda,

As a national of animal lovers, we should be critical of industries that exploit and abuse them. Ridglan Farms has been found to a massive perpetrator of animal abuse for decades. From the animals' perspective, they are victims. They feel pain. They want to be loved and cared for by decent people like yourself. Please use your power and fight with us for creating a better world. The puppies need you.

Thank you kindly,
Tommy
