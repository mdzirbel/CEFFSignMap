District Attorney Ozanne,

As a concerned citizen and also a dog lover, I am writing today because I am very worried that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. It has been brought to my attention that for many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue! I ask that you listen to your heart on this issue. I believe you understand right or wrong. And, this torture of our beloved canine friends is unconscionable and wrong!



Respectfully,

Steve Wang
