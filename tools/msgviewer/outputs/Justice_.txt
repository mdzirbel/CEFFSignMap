Dear Dane County DA Ismael Ozanne,

It is time for you to turn in your resignation if you believe it is appropriate for you to show up to a hearing and sit WITH Ridglan Farms! That place is nothing more than an undercover animal abuse facility and those who own it need to be in jail. A fitting 2x4 foot cell would be appropriate. They are breaking laws on a daily basis and you find NOTHING wrong with that?! I honestly donâ€™t know how you all sleep at night.
