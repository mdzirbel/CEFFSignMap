District Attorney Ozanne,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out with deep concern regarding the ongoing criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It has come to my attention that the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments over many decades, with numerous reports of egregious violations of state animal cruelty laws.

Some of the documented violations include surgical mutilations without the presence of anesthetics or veterinarians, confinement of dogs in small metal cages often in solitary conditions leading to severe psychological trauma, and inadequate flooring and housing resulting in foot injuries and infections, especially among vulnerable puppies.

It deeply troubles me that instead of addressing these serious offenses, your office has chosen to prosecute the courageous individuals working to rescue these innocent animals. I implore you to reconsider this approach and take decisive action against Ridglan Farms for their blatant disregard for animal welfare.

Please, let us not allow thousands of dogs in Dane County to continue suffering from criminal abuse. I urge you to prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms and send a clear message that animal cruelty will not be tolerated in our community.

Respectfully,

Namaah Hans
