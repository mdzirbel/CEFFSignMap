District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing this email because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County have not been addressed but they must be addressed to stop this abuse. Over many decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan Farms has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma to physically traumatized dogs
  *
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. If you would not allow anyone to harm a dog or cat that you know, please do not let these vulnerable dogs endure this cruelty. I encourage you to instead prosecute Ridglan Farms for their many documented offenses, not animal rescuers.


Respectfully,


Christine Doulis
