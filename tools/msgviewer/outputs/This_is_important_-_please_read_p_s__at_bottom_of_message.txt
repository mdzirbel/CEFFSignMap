District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Linda Russell



P.s.
I want you to imagine tomorrow you've switched lives with one of these dogs. You live in torment and none of it makes sense, you know you're good and don't deserve this. Several week or months pass and one day your life changes. Someone stepped up and put a stop to the cruelty you experience day after day and you're finally free. Whatever they did to make it happen, they did it. Imagine how learning what it's like to be cared for and loved for the first time in your life feels like. One person can make a difference. Don't you want to look back on your career and be able to say "I did it, I made a difference."? Thank you.
