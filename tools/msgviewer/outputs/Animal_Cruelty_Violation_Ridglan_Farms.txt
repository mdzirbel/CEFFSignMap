District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. The breeder is to be held to state laws and their AAALAC International accreditation - it seems they may be in violation of both.


Ridglan has been accused of violating state animal cruelty laws and their accreditation through the following:

  *   - Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   - Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   - Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I urge you to take these claims seriously, as medical testing breeders need to uphold a standard. This maintains professionalism within the field and reduces scrutiny from those whom disagree with the use of animals in medical research.


If diving into the matter deems the above true, please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.  Ensure Ridglan Farms loses their accreditation and prosecute their state crimes accordingly.

Respectfully,


Hayley Kinard
