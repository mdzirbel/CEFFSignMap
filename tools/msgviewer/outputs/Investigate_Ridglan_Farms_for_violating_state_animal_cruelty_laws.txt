Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I have been made aware of the animal cruelty practices taking place in Dane County at Ridglan Farms.

These beagles (warm kind dogs with personalities and the desire to be loved and cared for ) are being abused and this must be stopped.

Over many decades, the company has been breeding innocent dogs for brutal experiments. I can not imagine the despair and suffering they are enduring on a continuous basis.

It can be stopped.

Ridglan Farms has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws such as:


  *
surgical mutilations without anesthetics or a vet present (they cry just like humans)
  *
confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement
  *
improper flooring and conditions leading to an entire life of pain and suffering


 Courageous people have tried to help by getting some of the dogs out of this life of misery and they were persecuted.

It should be the Ridglan Farms who is investigated and shut down to stop this practice.

This is 2024 and as a county and human race we a re evolved beyond these practices. The general public does not want to see dogs tortured.

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.

Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal resucue.

Thank you,
Ellora Finch
