District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I deeply saddened that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is not being addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for horrific experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the heroes, the rescuers of these dogs, the savers of gentle souls. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to continue to endure criminal abuse. Please do the right thing.  Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Sincerely,
A concerned animal advocate,

Erin Mitchell
