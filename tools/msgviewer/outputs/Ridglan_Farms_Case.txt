Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


Over many decades, Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. I am writing because I believe these cases of animal abuse must be stopped.


Over the years, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of the dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Matteo Tonello
