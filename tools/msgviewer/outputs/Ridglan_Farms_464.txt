I wanted to voice my opposition to Ridglan Farms and to their criminal animal abuse that has been ongoing for decades.
I have been a voice for the voiceless for 50 years and I hope that in my lifetime I will see these companies that exploit and torture animals be closed down once and for all.  When i was younger there were few alternatives to animal experimentation, but now the businesses continue to test and retest when it is unnecessary and ludicrous.  Makes you wonder if any of those who work there havea heart at all.

Not only is this business cruel, but they have broken state laws regarding:
     Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
     Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
     Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

The old adage, don't shoot the messenger, applies here.  Ridglan Farms has been exposed for criminal activities and such horrendous abuse of innocent beings and yet they continue to operate, and those who expose them are prosecuted.
This is outrageous and they need to be shut down.

Sincerely,
Lonna Richmond
