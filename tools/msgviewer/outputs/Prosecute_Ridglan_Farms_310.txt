District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse is happening at Ridglan Farms in Dane County and must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

News of Ridglan Farm is all over social media, and due to it being in my state, I cannot sit idly by as this abuse takes place.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. Be on the correct side of history, and do something great for our state.



Respectfully,
