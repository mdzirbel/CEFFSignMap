Dear Attorney, Ozanne,

I am writing to you to request that you prosecute Ridglan Farms for Animal Cruelty. The blatant abuse, and in some cases medical torture in innocent victimized dogs, is outrageous and against the law, and Ridglan Farms must be duly punished.!!!!

Thank you,
Luellen Abdoo, NY, NY
