Dear DA Ozanne,

My name is James Cromwell. I am an actor and an animal rights advocate, and I am writing to ask you to prosecute Ridglan Farms for criminal animal cruelty.

At the Ridglan breeding facility, dogs endure cruel and inhumane conditions. Their cages are so small that they exhibit what experts call stereotypic behavior, meaning that they spin in circles constantly, bounce off of the walls, and bark frantically. This is an indication that they are experiencing extreme psychological and physical distress. They also suffer from exposure to constant light, even at night, and consistent foot injuries due to inadequate floor structures. They have been subjected to amateur surgeries performed without pain killers. All of this is clearly a violation of animal cruelty laws.

And if that's not enough, the Ridglan dogs ultimately end up being sold to laboratories for unnecessary experiments, such as being made to have strokes for hours on end (with high mortality rates), being force fed laundry detergent until they vomit blood and die, and being infected with diseases and parasites.

Other enforcement agencies are inadequate to address this problem. For instance, the USDA does not meaningfully enforce the Animal Welfare Act. But you have the power to help these innocent creatures by enforcing the law and prosecuting their abusers. Gentle beagles love humans unconditionally, and it's unthinkable that we repay them by torturing them in this way. Criminal animal cruelty of this kind must end. Please prosecute Ridglan Farms.

With Gratitude,
James Cromwell
