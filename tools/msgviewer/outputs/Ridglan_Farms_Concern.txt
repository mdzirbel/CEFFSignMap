Dear District Attorney,

I'm deeply troubled by the reports of ongoing animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. The repeated instances of cruelty documented over the years are unconscionable. Surgical mutilation without proper care, confinement leading to severe distress, and inadequate housing causing injuries are all violations of animal welfare laws. It's alarming that Ridglan Farms hasn't faced consequences for these actions. Instead, rescuers trying to help these animals are being prosecuted. I urge you to reconsider your priorities and hold Ridglan Farms accountable for the suffering they have caused.
