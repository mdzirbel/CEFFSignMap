Respected Mr. Ismael Ozanne,

I request please investigate the continuing misery and suffering of people from both the animal and human kingdoms at Ridglan Farms facility.

The abuse of suffering animals does no good to the people of Wisconsin and the people that are doing it to the beings who happen to be of the beagle species through no fault of their own.

The investigation of the activists who rescued some of the miserable animals was thorough. The questioning of the procedures of keeping the facility at sub-standards for humans caring for man's best friend was not done at all.

Peace to you in your work for Wisconsin and laws that protect and respect.

Respectfully,

Thompson
