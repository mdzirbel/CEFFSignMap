Our family has, grave, concerns that, the, criminal, animal abuse is being ignored in Dane County, specifically, at "Ridglan Farms", a, dog, breeder!  Your office has prosecuted the rescuers of beagles from horrific and unconscionable, conditions, but, has done nothing about the cruelty taking place at "Ridglan Farms" itself!

  *
District Attorney Ismael Ozanne has prosecuted, beagle, rescuers, but not criminal animal cruelty.

  *   Investigators, including the "USDA"’s, own, inspectors, have documented conditions that constitute violations of, animal, welfare laws!

  *   These include:

  1.   Surgical mutilation without anesthetics or a veterinarian present (which a, former, employee described as a “bloodbath”)!

  2.  Cruel confinement in tiny, metal, cages, barely, twice the length of the dogs, leading to psychological, torment, and, evidence of stress behavior like wailing, and, spinning, repeatedly, in circles, and clawing at the wall of the cage!

  3.  Improper, wire, flooring which injures the dogs’ paws, and, leads to infections, as well as openings that their legs fall through!

  *   These abuses have taken place over a, multi-year, timespan with NO indication that the problems have been addressed (including as, recently, as December 2023)!
