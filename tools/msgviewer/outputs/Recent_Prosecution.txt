Good afternoon,

I live in Dallas, Texas but have been following the Ridglan farms case due to my interest in animal welfare.  In my tenure on the Dallas Animal Shelter Commission and the Dallas Animal Cruelty Task Force, I learned that most animal research is flawed by its very nature and that animals who enter the research pipeline suffer abominably. I understand that Ridglan has violated any number of state animal cruelty laws.

Although charges against the activists involved in rescuing dogs from Ridglan have been dropped, I encourage you to look again at this case.  And to prosecute the people who have, indeed, committed a crime - those who run the Ridglan farms facility.


Sincerely,

Susan Oakey
Dallas, Texas
