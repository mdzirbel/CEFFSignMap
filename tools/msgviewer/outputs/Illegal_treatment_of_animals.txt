I'm writing to express serious concerns that criminal animal cruelty at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is not being tackled. For many years the company has been breeding dogs for experimentation purposes and during that time Ridglan has been witnessed contravening state laws relating to animal abuse. These include...


  *   Surgical procedures without pain relief and without any veterinary professionals being present

  *   Confinement (often solitary) in small metal cages, which leads to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Inadequate and improper flooring and housing, leading directly to causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Yet, instead of prosecuting Ridglan for such offences, you have prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Where is your moral compass? How can you possibly justify such a total inversion of natural justice?

You should not be letting any animals in your county to have criminal abuse inflicted on them.

It's time to do your job and prosecute Ridglan farms, not the animal rescuers.
