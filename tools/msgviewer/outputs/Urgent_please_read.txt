I am writing you because of the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County that must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. There is nothing humane about animal experiments; animals are living beings that do not deserve to live a life of suffering. They have emotions and unfortunately the ones being held at Ridglan Farms have known nothing but pain and fear their entire lifeâ€™s.  Please take action and help to free the animal so they can know love and peace in their life time.

Respectfully,
