Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I have been made aware of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. These crimes must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, that include:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies and more.


I do not understand why you would prosecute those who have brought these atrocities to light rather than the offenders -Ridglan.


Please do what people of this country expect you to do: Prosecute Criminals and especially when you have the hot evidence to do so.


Do you have any pets? Please! In good conscience do not turn your eyes away from thousands of dogs in your county enduring criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms.


Respectfully,



Carol Lynn Anderson
