I became aware that Ridgeland Farms, (which should not be called a farm ) is profiting off the extreme confinement of beagles, who are friendly dogs.
I have seen documented evidence in videos of just such abuse. Rather than prosecute people who care about the dogs and want to rehome them, I would suggest strongly that you Investigate and prosecute the ones committing the crime of animal abuse.
