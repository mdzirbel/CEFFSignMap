To District Attorney Ozanne:


Criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. For decades, Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. For decades. this business has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, including:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Thank you for your consideration of this important matter,
