District Attorney Ozanne,

I am a scientist and professor, and a proponent of animal rights. I have spent decades of my life researching the heinous treatment of animals forced into animal model research.

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present; Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs; and Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

History is changing. More and more humans are appalled about the heinous treatment animals suffer in animal model research.  I hope that in your heart, you have compassion for animals and that you act courageously.

Respectfully,
