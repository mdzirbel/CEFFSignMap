District Attorney Ozanne,

The verbiage below is cut and pasted verbatim from the sample prose prepared by an animal advocacy organization.  I am using it because it says what I want to express and there is no point in reinventing the wheel.  In addition, it is likely much more polite and restrained than my own words would be given that you have persecuted people trying to make this world a better place and thus far let those who inflict suffering on innocent creatures flout law and morality.  Please do better.


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:



  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies



Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.
