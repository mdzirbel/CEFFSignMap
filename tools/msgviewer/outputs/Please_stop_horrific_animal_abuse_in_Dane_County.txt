District Attorney Ozanne,

in light of the recent discoveries about animal abuse at Ridglan Farms, I am imploring you to take legal actions against Ridglan for their horrific, illegal, and unethical treatment of animals by the thousands.  The criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you wrongfully attempted to prosecute the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure more criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms immediately.

Respectfully,



Chuck Shuman
