District Attorney Ozanne,


“Man’s best friend” has been a phase used to describe dogs for decades. I am writing because I have major concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


These dogs need a voice, and how you can sit idly by while these animals are suffering is beyond me. Please be proactive in getting these animal proper care and stopping the criminal abuse that goes on at Ridglan. Please do some research on the company you choose not to prosecute. Watch the horrific videos of hundreds of beagles in the conditions they are in and then come back and say you refuse to help these animals. Please don’t be heartless.


Respectfully,


Ashley Edwards
