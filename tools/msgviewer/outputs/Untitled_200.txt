District Attorney Dane Coda,


I am sending this to you because of concerns I have about criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County that must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the Ridlan Farms has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or
 veterinarians present

Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted those who have  rescued these dogs. Please do not allow these  thousands of dogs in your county to suffer from criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Paul Vest
