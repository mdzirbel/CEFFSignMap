Honorable District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies
Dogs are sentient mammals that form strong bonds with their young, other mammals and humans.  They experience physical pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression from maltreatment and torture, just as humans did when Hitler’s Dr. Mengele conducted his cruel experiments on humans and animals at the death camps. That is why violations like Ridglan’s were made criminal offenses.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Debra S. Borys PhD FABPS
