District Attorney Ozanne,


I am deeply concerned about evidence of animal abuse happening to dogs who are

imprisoned at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

This has been well documented and recorded and includes:


Confinement in small barren cages with clear evidence of psychological distress with repetitive behaviours and clear desperation for freedom.


Surgical procedures to stop dogs barking undertaken routinely, which is reprehensible physical abuse.


Lack of proper housing leading to foot injuries and infections in puppies


Seeing these animals in such distress isolated from each other  by steel, does not satisfy any decent ethical personâ€™s view of animal welfare.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Yours faithfully


Dr Miranda Coulson
