District Attorney Ozanne,

I advocate today on behalf of the animals suffering abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. The criminals who work at this facility have been breeding dogs for cruel experiments for decades, violating state animal cruelty laws such as:

-Surgical mutilations without anesthetics nor veterinarians present

-Confinement of animals to cramped, uncomfortable metal cages, often in solitary confinement without proper socialization nor play resulting in psychological traumas

-Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

-Cruel experiments on pups resulting in severe injuries to animals including blindness

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these horrible crimes of animal abuse, you have instead prosecuted the compassionate rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Megan Long
