I am writing because there’s 😞CRIMINAL Animal ABUSE at Ridglan Farms in Dane County that 🙏🙏🙏must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present🧐😡😭
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement,😱 leading to psychological trauma for the dogs‼️
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies👎😢

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers🤨 of these dogs. Please GIVE JUSTICE to dogs in your county And Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

PLEASE Do What’s RIGHT,
