Hello,

I’m very concerned about the abuse going on at Ridglan Farms in Dane County and request that you close it down.  They’ve been breeding dogs for experimentation for decades and have broken many of the States animal cruelty laws.

Some of the abuses include doing procedures without anesthesia and putting dogs in isolation in small metal cages which hurts their feet and can cause injury.  As we know, dogs are like humans and can’t thrive in isolation so they suffer mentally too.

The people who live here don’t condone this abuse.

Thank you for doing the right thing
