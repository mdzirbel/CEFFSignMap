District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns about criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please take humane and progressive action by not allowing thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not those acting out of decency by rescuing these unfortunate animals.


Respectfully,
