District Attorney Ozanne,


I am contacting you today due to the criminal abuse of animals at Ridglan Farms, Dane County, which has been breeding dogs for experimentation for several decades. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I have read the CNN story (Who is Ismael Ozanne, Wisconsin’s prosecutor in Tony Robinson’s death?) of your history as the first black DA in Wisconsin and see you are a trail blazer.  Please set a precedent and stand up for these abused animals and prosecute Ridglan Farms for their crimes, not the rescuers/whistleblowers.



Respectfully,


Heather Knight
