District Attorney Ozanne,


The fact that criminal animal abuse is taking place at Ridglan Farms has come to my attention far from Dane County, on which it poorly reflects. As there has been quite some evidence presented, it's hard to understand why these crimes have not been addressed. Over many decades, the company has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Anyone who has ever had a family dog knows all this is wrong, and we depend on our law enforcement officials to stop criminal behavior. I would expect prosecution of Ridglan farms for any and all laws they break, and request that they be forced to comply with US federal and Wisconsin state law.


Respectfully,
