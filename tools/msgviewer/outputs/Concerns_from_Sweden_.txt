I am writing because the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. For far too long that company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. Ridglan has during this time been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

• Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present.

• Confinement in small metal cages, often solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

• Improper flooring and housing, causing paw injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not and why do do you allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.
