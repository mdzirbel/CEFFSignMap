District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing about the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Itâ€™s despicable that these acts are allowed to continue and that so many animals are being treated the way they are. The county should be ashamed to have this going on under their jurisdiction.


These acts would be subject to criminal prosecution if an individual committed them. Why is a corporation any different?

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Sincerely,
Alexis Farrington
