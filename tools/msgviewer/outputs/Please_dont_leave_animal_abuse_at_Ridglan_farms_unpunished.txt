District Attorney Ozanne,

    I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped immediately! Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   1. Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   2. Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   3. Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

   This is not to say that in my view or the publics’, animal experimentation would be ethical by any means if they were treated slightly less worse. Not in the slightest.



   Animal experimentation does not translate well to humans for example if we were trying to see if a lipstick would be safe for humans to use. It is only 90% accurate at most. We have developed human cells in a petri dish, we should use this, instead of hurting animals as it is unethical and unnecessarily.


    These dogs have emotions and are incredibly intelligent, empathetic, trusting and forgiving  beings. This is exactly why they are using them brutal experiments.


   Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Do not let this barbaric cruelty, this cruel betrayal of the dogs’ trust slide!

Respectfully,


Francis Szabo
