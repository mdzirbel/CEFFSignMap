Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

Ridglan Farms of Dane County is partaking in many unlawful practices through the brutal abuse of dogs. Violated laws include mutilations without anesthetics and extreme confinement. Ample evidence has been gathered supporting this.

I urge you to uphold the law, prosecute Ridglan farms, and execute the will of the people.


Sincerely,
