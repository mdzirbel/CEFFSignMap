Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I hope all is well.  I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is rampant and must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

- Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
- Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
- Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.  The feelings of these poor animals are no less than ours.  Please reconsider.  The most vulnerable, defenseless, and innocent beings deserve the utmost love and care and lives free of torture and killing.

Respectfully,

Krishna Majmudar
