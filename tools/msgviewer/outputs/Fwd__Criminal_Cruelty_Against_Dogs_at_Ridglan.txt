Subject: Criminal Cruelty Against Dogs at Ridglan
To: <ismael.ozanne@da.wi.gov<mailto:ismael.ozanne@da.wi.gov>>



District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing to express deep concerns about abuses at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. This company has been breeding dogs for experiments for too long. Disturbing violations against Beagles have been documented there, including:


  *   Surgeries without painkillers done without veterinarians

  *   Physical separation from other dogs

  *   Ongoing confinement in small metal cages

  *   Psychological trauma and stereotypical behavior like spinning

  *   Foot injuries and infections caused by flooring/housing


It appears that you are prosecuting rescuers instead of prosecuting Ridglan. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. This is traumatic for everyone, especially the dogs.


Thank you for your urgent attention to this dire situation,

Molly Flanagan
