Dear District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,

Please prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal cruelty. Their practices are useless, abusive, and cruel. The beagles end up being slaves to atrocious, painful experiments, which need to stop. Thank you for dropping charges for the good samaritans who rescued 3 beagles from horrific experimentation. The public was shocked to hear about the dogs' suffering and now supports the prosecution of Ridglan Farms. It's time to stop the abuse. Thank you.
