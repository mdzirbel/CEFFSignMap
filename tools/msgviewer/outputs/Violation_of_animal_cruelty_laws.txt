District Attorney Ozanne,

I have been to Madison, WI dozens of times for work, and I always enjoyed my time there.

I am writing because I have seen videos and pictures online of terrible animal cruelty at a business in Dane County called Ridglan Farms. I know you are already aware of these pictures and videos because you decided to prosecute those that exposed the terrible conditions, but not Ridglan Farms. Thousands of poor dogs are confined in small metal cages, with improper flooring, causing injuries and infections, and the abuse and trauma these animals are enduring at Ridglan Farms is clear to anyone with eyes, ears, and a heart. Additionally, a former employee has blown the whistle about surgical mutilations performed at Ridglan Farms, not by a veterinarian and without pain medication.

Please do something about this. Please prosecute Ridglan Farms for these unlawful and barbaric business practices.

Thank you,
Linda Winkowski
