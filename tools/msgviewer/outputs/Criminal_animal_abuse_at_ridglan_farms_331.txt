District Attorneys,

Good day. I've been reading disturbing details about criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, WI, and I'm concerned that no legal action has been taken.  Over several decades, Ridglan has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments and has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

- Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
- Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
- Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Sincerely,
Julia Neuroth
