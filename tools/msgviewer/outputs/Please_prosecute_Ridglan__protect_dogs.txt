Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing issue of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms within Dane County, an urgent matter that demands immediate action. For many years, this establishment has been breeding dogs to conduct harsh experiments. Throughout this period, numerous instances of state animal cruelty law violations by Ridglan have been documented, including:

  *   They perform surgical procedures on animals without using anesthetics or the oversight of qualified veterinarians.
  *   They are subjecting dogs to confinement in cramped metal cages, often in isolation, which has resulted in significant psychological harm.
  *   They provide inadequate flooring and living conditions, leading to foot injuries and infections among the puppies.


Regrettably, rather than taking legal action against Ridglan for these violations, efforts have been directed toward prosecuting individuals who have attempted to rescue these dogs. I implore you to shift the focus of legal actions toward prosecuting Ridglan Farms to prevent the further suffering of thousands of dogs in your jurisdiction.


Please prosecute Ridglan now! Dogs are man's best friend. They deserve better than this.



Best regards,

--
