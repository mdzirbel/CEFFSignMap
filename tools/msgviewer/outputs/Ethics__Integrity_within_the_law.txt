District Attorney Ozanne, "Hello"

I am writing because I am a good person & I speak up on behalf of animals because animals cannot speak for themselves. The fact remains that criminal animal abuse is rife at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. This atrocity must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I ask with respect - Where is the  justice? Where are the ethics? Where is the integrity of law here?  Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Protecting businesses that neglect & abuse for profit is not Godly. What happened to, "In God We Trust"?

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not the good people who with courage try to stop animal rescue. This is truth.

Gandhi said, 'Be the change you want to see in the world' - I am doing just that.

Respectfully,
Caroline van Haeften
