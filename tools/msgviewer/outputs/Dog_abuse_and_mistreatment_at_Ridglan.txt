To whom is reading,

Imagine if your children were being mutilated like those dogs dear friend. Do the right thing and work to shut it down. “A righteous man cares for his beast.”

“to whom much is given, much will be required” (Luke 12:48)
Surgical mutilations without anesthesia, no creature deserves this treatment.
Confinement in small cages, what crime did the dogs commit to deserve imprisonment.
Improper flooring, causing infection, even dictators in Central Asia treat their beasts better.

If those who domesticated dogs saw this future, then we would have none. The same treatments will be found for you in hell if you do not repent.

Good day or night
