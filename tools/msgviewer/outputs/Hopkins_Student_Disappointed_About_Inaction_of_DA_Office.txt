District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. As someone who has gone to Hopkins and learned about the importance of the judicial system in holding big corporations accountable, I can frankly say I am dissatisfied with the inaction taken by your office. While it is the people who voted for you, it is the big corporations who you protect. I hope you can realize one day that your inaction will be the direct cause of the suffering beagles.


Respectfully,


Anni Fan
