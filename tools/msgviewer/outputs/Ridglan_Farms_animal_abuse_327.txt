District Attorney Ozanne:

My name is Tessa Pacelli and I am a dog owner and animal lover. I also have a background in science and business. My undergraduate degree is from Stanford University and my MBA is from Harvard Business School.

Having been exposed to and educated by some of the best in the best in science and business, I believe that:

(1) No reputable research program or scientist undertakes cruel, inhumane, abusive "experiments" on dogs.
(2) No reputable business tests consumer products on dogs when there are numerous other humane methods available.

I have watched videos, reviewed pictures, and read first hand accounts of the procedures and "experiments" at Ridglan. They are, quite simply, criminal animal abuse. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

- Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
- Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
- Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I beg you to stand up for our canine friends in Dane County. They feel pain, cruelty. and sadness as real as any person. These beautiful dogs have done nothing to deserve the horrible fate of being a "lab animal" at Ridglan Farms - other than being sweet, calm, and pliant enough to be easily manipulated for "experiments".

I respectfully request that you take action to stop the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Tessa Pacelli
