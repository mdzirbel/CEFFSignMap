District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,

Are you planning to do anything about
the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms? It’s a breeder of beagles sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel
confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.

You prosecuted beagle rescuers, but not criminal animal cruelty. Investigators, including the USDA’s own inspectors, have documented conditions that constitute violations of animal welfare laws.

Please, help,

Michelle Setaro
