District Attorney Ozanne,
Please investigate and  prosecute Ridglan Farms in Dane County for animal abuse. They breed dogs for experimentation and for years and years have treated the dogs so poorly, it warrants prosecutorial action. They have violated several state animal cruelty laws, including isolation of the dogs, improper housing (they use metal bar cages) that leads to foot pain and impairment for the dogs, long confinement in these barren metal cages, surgical mutilations without actual veterinarians present and without pain relief, the list goes on.
I hope you'll stop prosecuting the people who are saving these dogs, the animal rescuers. They are bringing to light egregious acts against living beings in your county. The ones committing the real crimes--Ridglan Farms--are who should be prosecuted. They're the ones hurting others, not the animal rescuers.
Thank you,
Emily V.
