District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have HIGH concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments.
This is absolutely unacceptable and morally wrong on a humane level, but also for anyone with an ounce of empathy for other living beings.
During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


-Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
-Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement; leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
-Improper flooring and housing; causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs, which makes no logical sense at all, and I'd like to believe you have more than enough common sense to see how backwards that is.
Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse under your time in office.
Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Ashley
