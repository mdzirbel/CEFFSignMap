As someone very concerned about the health and wellness of animals, and doing the right thing in the face of animal suffering, Iâ€™m asking you to investigate and charge the people who are causing beagles to suffer at Ridglan Farms. I have seen the videos and there is clearly mistreatment of these dogs going on. If these were privately owned animals, there would be enough evidence to have these dogs removed from those owners.

Do the right thing and shut this place down.
