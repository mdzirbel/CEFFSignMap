- Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

 I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding ongoing issues at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which I believe demand immediate legal attention. It has come to my attention that the facility has been engaged in practices that could constitute criminal animal abuse, specifically in their handling and treatment of dogs used in experimental procedures. Reports and observations suggest a troubling pattern of behavior at Ridglan Farms,

including:

 - Performing surgical procedures on animals without the use of anesthesia or the presence of qualified veterinary care.
- Keeping dogs isolated in cramped metal enclosures, a situation that can lead to severe psychological distress.
- Utilizing inadequate flooring materials, contributing to a high incidence of injuries and infections among the animals, especially young puppies. While I understand the complexities involved in cases related to animal welfare, it concerns me that actions taken so far have targeted individuals attempting to intervene on behalf of these animals rather than addressing the root cause of the abuse at Ridglan Farms.

 I respectfully urge your office to reevaluate the situation at Ridglan Farms with a view towards holding those responsible for these cruel practices accountable under the law. It is crucial that our community upholds strong standards of animal welfare and that entities which violate these standards are subjected to appropriate legal scrutiny and action. Thank you for considering my concerns. I trust in your commitment to justice and the welfare of all beings in
Dane County.

Sincerely,
Roberto
