To:

District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,

Dane County, Wisconsin.

Dear Sir,

Thousands of beagles are trapped in cages, waiting to be tortured in cruel and useless experiments by Ridglan Farms.

Criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped as soon as possible.

This company is infamous for breeding dogs for brutal and senseless experiments for decades.

During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Please do not allow thousands of innocent, friendly dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescuers!

Thank you,

Sincerely,
Chantal Buslot Belgium
