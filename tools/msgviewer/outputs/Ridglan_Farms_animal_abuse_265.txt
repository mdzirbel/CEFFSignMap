I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing issue of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It is imperative that action is taken to address and put an end to these egregious practices.

For far too long, Ridglan Farms has been involved in breeding dogs for brutal experiments, spanning many decades. This has resulted in numerous violations of state animal cruelty laws, including but not limited to:

- Surgical mutilations being performed without the presence of anesthetics or veterinarians

- Confinement of animals in small metal cages, often in solitary conditions, leading to severe psychological trauma for the dogs

- Inadequate flooring and housing conditions, resulting in foot injuries and infections among vulnerable puppies

Despite these clear violations, it is concerning that instead of holding Ridglan Farms accountable for their actions, efforts have been directed towards prosecuting individuals involved in rescuing these mistreated animals. This approach is not only unjust but also fails to address the root cause of the problem.

I urge you to take immediate action to prosecute Ridglan Farms for their offenses and to ensure that justice is served for the thousands of dogs subjected to criminal abuse under their care. It is imperative that we prioritize the well-being and protection of these innocent animals and hold those responsible for their suffering accountable.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will take the necessary steps to address these concerns promptly.

Respectfully,


Timothy Armstrong
