District Attorney Ozanne,


I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding ongoing instances of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It's troubling to note that despite numerous reports and evidence of wrongdoing, the company continues to operate unchecked.

Some of the reported violations include surgical procedures performed without proper anesthesia or veterinary oversight, confinement of animals in small, solitary metal cages leading to severe psychological distress, and inadequate housing conditions resulting in injuries and infections among the animals, particularly puppies.

What is concerning is that instead of taking action against Ridglan Farms for these egregious violations of animal cruelty laws, there have been instances where those attempting to rescue and bring attention to these issues have faced legal repercussions.

It is imperative that swift and decisive action be taken to address and rectify these grave injustices. I urge you to prioritize the welfare and protection of these animals by prosecuting Ridglan Farms for their actions, rather than penalizing those advocating for their well-being.

Respectfully, Sally
