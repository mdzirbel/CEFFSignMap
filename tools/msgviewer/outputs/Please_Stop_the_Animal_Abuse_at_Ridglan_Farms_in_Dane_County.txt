District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have major concerns about how animals are being treated in your district. The criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


I work for a non profit animal shelter and also spend many hours volunteering. We need you to protect those of us who speak for the animals that cannot. Please do not continue to let these animals needlessly suffer. Please make sure those with excess money do not continue to use it to hurt our community.


Sincerely,


Elizabeth Allen
