I'm writing to you about Madison, Wisconsin where dozens of animal advocates are currently demonstrating outside the Dane County District Attorney's Office, calling for charges to be filed against Ridglan Farms, one of the last remaining beagle factory farms in the US. Inside this facility, DxE investigators have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls.
Riddled Farms should be shut down. This is animal cruelty.
Please help these animals.
