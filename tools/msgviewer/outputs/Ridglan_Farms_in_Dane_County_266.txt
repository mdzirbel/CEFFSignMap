I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the ongoing issue at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

The treatment of animals on their premises raises serious ethical and legal questions that demand attention. Instances of surgical procedures performed without appropriate anesthesia or veterinary oversight, as well as the confinement of animals in substandard conditions, highlight a pattern of disregard for animal welfare laws.

It is troubling to note that, rather than addressing these violations directly, there appears to be a focus on prosecuting individuals attempting to intervene and rescue the affected animals.

I respectfully urge you to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of Ridglan Farms for their alleged violations, ensuring that justice is served and that the well-being of the animals is safeguarded.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
