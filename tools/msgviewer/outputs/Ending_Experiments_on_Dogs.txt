District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

        • Surgical mutilations without anaesthetics or veterinarians present
        • Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
        • Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offences, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,


Nicolò Fabbri
