District Attorney Ozanne,

I have viewed footage and read accounts of criminal abuse and violations of state animal cruelty laws at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

The overwhelming majority of the public would be distressed to learn that dogs confined in tiny metal cages endure surgery without anesthesia.

Please prosecute Ridglan Farms for offenses against thousands of dogs in your county, not the people who expose the abuse.

Respectfully,

Jennifer Jones, CVT
