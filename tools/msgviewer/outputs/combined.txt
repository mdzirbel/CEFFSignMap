Animals should not be experimented on. Period. They are not ours to use, abuse, or exploit. This is highly unethical and cruel.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I have recently been made aware that criminal animal abuse is taking place under your county. Why is the prosecution being directed to those who intend to rescue the disrespected life and not to those committing violent acts against our fellow inhabitants? Ridglan Farms in Dane county has been operating under the constant violations against state animal cruelty laws such as non-anesthetized surgical mutilations, psychologically traumatic solitary confinement, and over all mistreatment, all under your watch. Am I supposed to sit here in silence while you have thousands of lives hanging off the palm of your hands or are you going to do something about it?

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


Breaking the Law should be prosecuted which is why I am writing to you.


Ridglan Farms is breaking the laws that you are bound to uphold. I am asking you to do your job.


Whatever Ridglan is attempting to hide behind locked doors needs to be exposed to the public, and to your self. Please hold them accountable for the harm they are committing.


And please back-off of the people who fight for what is morally right. Please stand on the RIGHT side of the law!

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I am appalled by your lack of interest in stopping the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. As you know, over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, including

* Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
* Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
* Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you attempted to prosecute the rescuers of these dogs. Indeed, you would have, if Ridglan themselves had not requested the case be dropped, because they did not want the full scale of their crimes revealed during the course of the trial.

Mr. Ozanne, it is time for your to do your job. Thousands of dogs in Dane County are enduring criminal abuse, right now. Your are morally and ethically obligated to prosecute Ridglan Farms for their decades-long crime spree.

Dane County District Attorney's Office,

As a child, I grew up with a beagle we had at home. Our dog was a wonderful being who taught me about love and affection. With that in mind, I am deeply saddened to learn of the animal abuse occurring at Ridglan Farms. This abuse includes surgery without anesthesia and housing these highly social creatures in solitary wire cages. This must stop. Please use the power of your office to prosecute those abusing animals rather than those rescuing animals.

Hello,

I am writing because of the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  This can no longer be shoved under the rug.   Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

• Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
• Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
• Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Thousands of these animals in breeding facilities in our state live a miserable caged existence, bred for unnecessary experiments that do not transfer to human use.   Wisconsin is one of the epicenters of animal research in the United States and has the dubious distinction of being #1 in the United States for research on both dogs and cats; #2 for rabbits.

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Dear Sir,
I live in Michigan where we highly respect our dogs. It’s beyond my comprehension that Wisconsin would allow such heinous behavior to exist in the state. Please Sir do everything in your power to pass legislation outlawing such contemptible treatment of dogs. Put these people out of business and rescue these suffering animals from such horrific living conditions. No animal deserves to be treated like this. Give these dogs the respect they deserve and a life of dignity.
Thank you for your time.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. These are sentient beings who feel pain and terror just as much as you and I. The tide is turning and soon we will look back on such practices as totally barbarian and unnecessary. Please be at the forefront of this movement. Show compassion. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

I am writing because of the criminal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. For many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for  awful experiments. It make me sick to my stomach to think what they have done to these dogs.

Don't prosecute the rescuers for doing the right thing! Prosecute Ridglan Farms for performing surgery on these dogs without anesthetics or having a veterinarian present.

Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws.

You must not own dogs or you would feel differently.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Each moment you allow this abuse to continue unchecked, you allow these dogs to suffer unimaginable cruelty.


I believe it is your job to do everything in your power to defend those who can’t defend themselves—including the animals in your district who need someone in your position to fight for them. I hope you will stand with the animal rescuers who have put their own safety and futures on the line to save lives. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Hello!

PLEASE prosecute the people at Ridgland Farms for their inhumane treatment of innocent dogs there.  Locked in small cages, swollen feet due to wire cage floors, filthy cages.

YOU can help these poor animals!  Please do so now.

Thank you,

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the ongoing criminal animal abuse occurring at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It is imperative that this matter is addressed and stopped immediately. For many decades, Ridglan Farms has been involved in breeding dogs for the purpose of brutal experiments. During this time, numerous instances of violations of state animal cruelty laws have been documented, including:

- Performing surgical mutilations on dogs without the use of anesthetics or the presence of veterinarians.
- Keeping dogs confined in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, which has led to severe psychological trauma.
- Providing improper flooring and housing conditions, resulting in foot injuries and infections, particularly among puppies.

Despite these clear violations, it is disheartening to see that instead of prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these offenses, the authorities have chosen to prosecute individuals who have attempted to rescue these mistreated dogs. This situation is unacceptable. I urge you to take immediate action to stop the abuse and ensure that Ridglan Farms is held accountable for their actions. The thousands of dogs suffering in your county deserve protection and justice. Please prioritize prosecuting Ridglan Farms for their criminal activities rather than those who seek to rescue and care for these animals.

Respectfully,
Kirsten Friche

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing in response to the animal cruelty footage I have seen at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

I am asking your office to do the will of the people and address and stop this with your power.

People do not want this ignored and what you do now will show the character of your office and the level of your compassion.

Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws many times:
● Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
● Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological
trauma for the dogs
● Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies
Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.
Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Good morning, Mr. Ozanne,

Please do the right thing and prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal cruelty.  You don’t have to be a pet owner or dog lover to see the abhorrent cruelty in this facility.

There is absolutely no scientific reason for a place like Ridglan Farms to exist.

Please do the right thing here.

Thank you,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Are you planning to do anything about the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms?  It’s a breeder of beagles sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.

This is vicious.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. The breeder is to be held to state laws and their AAALAC International accreditation - it seems they may be in violation of both.


Ridglan has been accused of violating state animal cruelty laws and their accreditation through the following:

  *   - Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   - Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   - Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I urge you to take these claims seriously, as medical testing breeders need to uphold a standard. This maintains professionalism within the field and reduces scrutiny from those whom disagree with the use of animals in medical research.


If diving into the matter deems the above true, please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.  Ensure Ridglan Farms loses their accreditation and prosecute their state crimes accordingly.

Respectfully,

Good afternoon Attorney Ozanne,


The following is a template email that exercises the thoughts of many, however I would seek to add that both the use and keeping of animals for any experimentation - medical or otherwise - is both against the rights of other living beings, cruel beyond measure and, with the advent of new technologies, now fundamentally unnecessary. Please look to the future, hold those culpable of malpractice to account and advocate in the strongest possible terms for a future free of animals testing and torture.


Thank you.

Please address the horrific animal abuse at Ridglan farms. Dogs are driven insane being confined in small cages. Their paws are painful due to standing on wire. The dogs eyes are burning from urine and feces fumes! Stop this horrible torture of animals. Stand up for what’s morally and ethically just! Animals are sentient beings who suffer egregiously in cages and laboratories!!

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I have read with concern allegations of abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. I am writing to ask you to please investigate and address these charges. As you have no doubt heard, the company has been breeding dogs for experiments that are alleged to be inhumane. These include surgical mutilations without anesthetics. There are also numerous other issues that have been observed.

I am concerned that you seem to have been criminally pursuing folks who have been focused on the welfare of these animals. I would ask you instead to explore prosecuting Ridglan for their offenses.

Thank you for taking the time to read this email.

Hi,

My name is Madelyn Bingham, I am asking District Attorney Ismael Ozanne to prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal cruelty. The press I have seen recently has been incredibly disturbing. Veterinarians and inspectors as recent as December 2023 have noted abnormal behavior in their beagles, as well as puppies not being able to walk or stand correctly due to improper flooring or their cages. I am urgently asking you to prosecute them for this abuse and negligence. These dogs are sentient being that can suffer greatly physically and emotionally and deserve more than they are getting. Please don’t let down your constituents with this case and hold Ridglan Farms accountable. This will set a precedent that we as a county care for our animal companions and their wellbeing.

Thank you for your time,

Dear Sir,

Please can you stop the breeding of animals for experimentation at Ridglan? It is truly an evil place for animals, along with many others like them.

In our 21st century, no animal should be suffering at the hands of man, anywhere in the world. Experimentation on animals is very poor at finding human cures. Digital and technological means is 100% accurate. Why then, is America, a supposedly civilised country, along with other, supposedly, civilised countries not using digital methods, causing no suffering at all?

Why then, are animals suffering incarceration in hideous surroundings, being experimented upon constantly, being bred for the purposes of experimentation and living dismal lives? If sentient humans then feel and see their suffering, rescue them from hellish lives, they are arrested and dragged through the courts, only then for cases to be dropped by these horribly wealthy companies because they don't want intrusion and investigations into the cruel experiments conducted and the horrid lives animals suffer.

As human beings, we need sentience toward every animal on the planet. They're all precious and need our help and support when being exploited by humans for profit and gain. They are not ours to abuse, profit from and exploit. They deserve a good, enjoyable life, as humans do.

Lawmakers need to stop rescuers of all animals being dragged through the courts. Abusers should be, but not rescuers. In 2024 humans should be treating animals as equals shouldn't they?

Thank you for reading my email.

Yours sincerely,
S H Challenger (Mrs)

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

I hope you take the time to look at the animals you know and love and have enough respect for them to help these other animals in desperate need. No living being should be treated in such ways.

District Attorney Ozanne,

 I am writing to express my concerns regarding the ongoing criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which urgently needs to be addressed and halted.

For decades, the company has been breeding dogs for cruel experiments, consistently violating state animal cruelty laws. These violations include surgical mutilations performed without anesthesia or veterinary oversight, confinement of dogs in small metal cages often in solitary conditions leading to psychological trauma, and inadequate flooring and housing resulting in foot injuries and infections in puppies.

 Rather than holding Ridglan accountable for these egregious offenses, it appears that your office has chosen to prosecute those who attempt to rescue these suffering animals.

I urge you to redirect your efforts and prosecute Ridglan Farms for their clear violations of animal welfare laws.

Thousands of dogs in your county are enduring criminal abuse, and it is imperative that action is taken to ensure justice and protection for these innocent animals.

 Respectfully,

Ruxanda Balan

To whom it may concern,

I have been following the Ridglan Farm rescue situation.

The case against the activists has been dismissed which actually means Ridglan Farm is guilty of animal abuse.

Action must be taken. I have looked at their website and they are stating Class A and have the highest standards of health for the animals.

This case has been a huge waste of tax payers money and yet Ridglan is at fault.

You have a responsibility here.

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

As a Bay Area college student with aspirations to become a veterinarian, and a dedicated volunteer at my local animal shelter, I am deeply troubled by the ongoing reports of animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

The violations of state animal cruelty laws, including surgical procedures without proper anesthetics, confinement in small cages causing psychological trauma, and inadequate housing leading to injupries and infections, are deeply concerning to me.

I am committed to advocating for every animal that is being abused, and I urge you to prioritize the well-being of these innocent animals by taking decisive action against Ridglan Farms. It is disheartening to hear that rescuers are being prosecuted instead of the perpetrators. Please reconsider this approach and support the efforts of those who are working tirelessly to rescue and care for these mistreated animals.

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. I trust that you will do what is right for the voiceless animals who rely on our protection.

Sincerely,

I am writing because the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. For far too long that company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. Ridglan has during this time been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

• Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present.

• Confinement in small metal cages, often solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

• Improper flooring and housing, causing paw injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not and why do do you allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

District Attorney Ozanne,


The fact that criminal animal abuse is taking place at Ridglan Farms has come to my attention far from Dane County, on which it poorly reflects. As there has been quite some evidence presented, it's hard to understand why these crimes have not been addressed. Over many decades, the company has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Anyone who has ever had a family dog knows all this is wrong, and we depend on our law enforcement officials to stop criminal behavior. I would expect prosecution of Ridglan farms for any and all laws they break, and request that they be forced to comply with US federal and Wisconsin state law.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing to express my grave concerns regarding the ongoing issue of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. For decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments, in clear violation of state animal cruelty laws. These violations include performing surgical procedures without proper anesthesia or veterinary supervision, subjecting animals to confinement in cramped metal cages leading to severe psychological distress, and maintaining inadequate housing conditions resulting in injuries and infections among the puppies.

Rather than holding Ridglan Farms accountable for these egregious offenses, it has come to my attention that your office has chosen to prosecute individuals who have attempted to rescue these suffering animals. I implore you to prioritize the welfare of thousands of dogs in your county and take decisive legal action against Ridglan Farms, instead of targeting those who seek to protect these innocent creatures.


I know it easy to follow the rules and the system, but what do you want to look back on in the future. that YOU ignored thousands of dogs lives that needed YOUR help or that YOU helped thousands of innocent dogs?
And what would you want others to do if you were in their position?

Dogs give us complete trust and loyalty. They help us in many ways such as guide dogs and police dogs which gives the dogs an excellent quality of life and the relationships with humans that they need. Using these gentle intelligent animals for experiments is both  both inhumane and totally unnecessary. Humans do not respond to things in the same way as dogs do, so anything tested on animals has to be retested on humans.

Please ensure that all cruelty is stopped and give these beautiful creatures the life they deserve.

Thank you so much

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offers , you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

You have the chance to change the lives of countless animals that are currently experiencing inhumane conditions and prevent the abuse of future animals. As a dog owner and animal lover, I  hope you choose to be on the right side of history.

To whom is reading,

Imagine if your children were being mutilated like those dogs dear friend. Do the right thing and work to shut it down. “A righteous man cares for his beast.”

“to whom much is given, much will be required” (Luke 12:48)
Surgical mutilations without anesthesia, no creature deserves this treatment.
Confinement in small cages, what crime did the dogs commit to deserve imprisonment.
Improper flooring, causing infection, even dictators in Central Asia treat their beasts better.

If those who domesticated dogs saw this future, then we would have none. The same treatments will be found for you in hell if you do not repent.

As someone very concerned about the health and wellness of animals, and doing the right thing in the face of animal suffering, I’m asking you to investigate and charge the people who are causing beagles to suffer at Ridglan Farms. I have seen the videos and there is clearly mistreatment of these dogs going on. If these were privately owned animals, there would be enough evidence to have these dogs removed from those owners.

Do the right thing and shut this place down.

District Attorney Ozanne, "Hello"

I am writing because I am a good person & I speak up on behalf of animals because animals cannot speak for themselves. The fact remains that criminal animal abuse is rife at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. This atrocity must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I ask with respect - Where is the  justice? Where are the ethics? Where is the integrity of law here?  Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Protecting businesses that neglect & abuse for profit is not Godly. What happened to, "In God We Trust"?

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not the good people who with courage try to stop animal rescue. This is truth.

Respected Mr. Ismael Ozanne,

I request please investigate the continuing misery and suffering of people from both the animal and human kingdoms at Ridglan Farms facility.

The abuse of suffering animals does no good to the people of Wisconsin and the people that are doing it to the beings who happen to be of the beagle species through no fault of their own.

The investigation of the activists who rescued some of the miserable animals was thorough. The questioning of the procedures of keeping the facility at sub-standards for humans caring for man's best friend was not done at all.

Peace to you in your work for Wisconsin and laws that protect and respect.

Respectfully,

Thompson

Hello,

I understand that Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is a very busy man with a very important job to do, handling domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, child neglect & homicide. ALL of which are so very important. I urge DA Ozanne to use his authority & influence to improve the 'humanity' within the law that must pertain to ALL living things that feel pain & suffering.

It is unfathomable to me when I see justice systems protect criminals & jail courageous human beings who speak up against the neglect & abuse of living things. A just & true law would state that a rescuer, a protector is never a criminal.

I urge DA Ozanne to be the first to challenge inhumane 'turn a blind eye' "sweep it under the carpet' laws when it comes to the for profit animal breeding, animal agriculture & animal testing organizations that get away with horrific neglect & abuse. ALL animal organizations MUST be held accountable for abuse & neglect. Period.

In the past when confronting & challenging judicial laws DA Ozanne requested a Supreme Court Justice with ties to lawyers arguing a case step aside, an act the New York Times called “brave.”   WOW! Brave man for sure.

I ask with respect, humility & boldness District Attorney Ismael Ozanne please address the criminal abuse at Ridglan Farms.

While I write/send this email many helpless animals are suffering, you Sir can put a STOP to it!

Animals are the last bastion of slavery, bought & sold like objects. Living beings are NOT objects.

Thank you for the privilege of sending this email.

Subject: Ridglan Farms in Dane County


District Attorney Ozanne,


My reason for writing is that I am genuinely concerned that allegations of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County have been made that must be addressed and stopped.


The company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments over many years.   During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present;

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs;

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.


I believe that Ridglan should be prosecuted for these allegations, if proved.


The general public cannot bear the thought of animal abuse and suffering to be ongoing at all.  Animal experimentation is being challenged owing to its failure to show efficacy and there are now better non-animal ways.  Please therefore, if there is animal abuse occurring at Ridglan, can you use your power and prosecute?  The rescuers are acting according to their consciences and are morally, good people and should never be prosecuted for that.


Yours sincerely,



Eileen Gibson

Hi Christine,

I'm writing to you from Madison, Wisconsin where dozens of animal advocates are currently demonstrating outside the Dane County District Attorney's Office, calling for charges to be filed against Ridglan Farms, one of the last remaining beagle factory farms in the US. Inside this facility, DxE investigators have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls.

On March 8, the District Attorney dropped all charges<http://url4133.mail.directactioneverywhere.com/ls/click?upn=u001.71uDLRXpj34gONlqvUsU-2BMqs3fbe0qOX1Pk-2Bx4OqbUUAl8RlFWmiV-2BVP3hOaIDHsXPmj7b4N-2B2tykEZrQwRhNjJfp8pJzH68msAhBnjrvqXd66W4rTNpDRrsSqgzSjf6y-2B3HKPvpUGKsvit3OIvIYi-2BKbFUIzd2rljfT9N2iZCP-2Fm6DPEvhTPi2hsAZ0NdxEyx0G_dIkUTa8jGc02McqirfJIFKzZL2-2FtZGJhmVZkvoxUYUqxhJIZlixyLZK3OVfK63qYMmDDXP-2BHFvQJi7ak-2FLWb2ysPaSJmGXW6haUGCDPssxiw55oYprntdOO5K5JrJUzh-2Ffv46shaYnHZ4CE-2Bl1Vhsix8hGcaq4F541AYFRZNaFCqBCRfvQeuID89itoCPomLIglT5JS7EtIeF6vW7hkUuZrZw642-2BqM3siRdlr3FO-2BaEhyUKCEjJA57uCDyiubD3aKHjXyz5Efd-2FfTtLWu3nh72OuGG9cKjDTsfbPSq4kYDNnwn8h1GhDq2suGDKqi4kjYF9oAUDSlylffmcaG5uP46ZKZFIQ2yfbj-2BcO4lY8TVyWz1ggAJunl-2B2-2BggCYKJITRB6n8UpMhTW652mtNqxLVAdW-2Bvs0foEtnTKluJ4vSbNUCFg0xsiYDJ5OHn4jDTPM3BEdmNNJVc4-2BK8RRNodmwasYso1TYp6nUH56iQOye86DY5lWBAs9gC8ZksVK7MqJPv5ofrKiCpqiuwL0a0AhAFQDZvas3mh4ZWl11B-2FlMPk2dYmBp-2FBtYz4JdY4tegGKagvjjijtvjfDiag3V-2Bzsp-2FrpHgZo-2B7uvGREz-2BTGEaWitrY2YyONZQhFOFZHh2G3-2F36Kd1FroCYUaHGwylH8DaGR6kdcACpYUfnUFoYRfgNhlHhmD0N1hZJfNeboZfuFZ-2BmHsPfq17ULoZV-2FFMwF7hoFW4un4RcYpNiyB6xE3u9pYPVFr4-2BpDBqNNJB8jyM1MnpaWqwUMh5rRcGT1WJ7kwZvtuLyZWaEerbVaQ6cCe6cqswAOOXKCitiJx2r9kFltqm08ssQc3Og8C-2BoF-2BOnNzNwZUSY0ENICQpQ-2BY-2B-2BlbF5JFkeMQl5e60c-2F30u2CfTLonv56Ftbvr8VA27IEWcp-2BDMNGMVuGWPfc8yAiQSYdg77l21t6B9UE2oKOXLUZLN> against three people who were involved in a DxE investigation and open rescue at Ridglan Farms in 2017.

They wanted us to stay home and stay silent. Instead, we're coming together and raising our voices all week to demand justice for the dogs abused by Ridglan. And you can help!

Please contact Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne and ask him to address the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms:

I see the charges have been dropped which is encouraging, however animal abuse and cruelty is still ongoing at Ridglan Farms. There should be further action and investigation into their practices and I hope that some action will be taken going forward.

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing to express deep concerns about abuses at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. This company has been breeding dogs for experiments for too long. Disturbing violations against Beagles have been documented there, including:


  *   Surgeries without painkillers done without veterinarians

  *   Physical separation from other dogs

  *   Ongoing confinement in small metal cages

  *   Psychological trauma and stereotypical behavior like spinning

  *   Foot injuries and infections caused by flooring/housing


It appears that you are prosecuting rescuers instead of prosecuting Ridglan. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. This is traumatic for everyone, especially the dogs.


Thank you for your urgent attention to this dire situation,

Molly Flanagan

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I believe that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, far too long to thing about, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Ridglan has shown that they have no compassion or care for other living beings, while the rescuers have shown just that and more. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. Go with compassion.

 Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am reaching out to express my concerns regarding what I believe to be serious instances of criminal animal abuse occurring at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which I feel require urgent attention and action.

For many years, it has come to light that Ridglan Farms has been engaged in the breeding of dogs for experiments, a practice that has raised significant ethical and legal questions. During this period, there have been multiple observations suggesting that the facility has not adhered to state animal cruelty laws, including but not limited to:

- Performing surgical procedures without the use of anesthetics or the supervision of qualified veterinarians.
- Housing dogs in small, metal cages for extended periods, often in isolation, which can lead to severe psychological distress.
- Utilizing improper flooring and housing conditions that have resulted in foot injuries and infections among the puppies.

It has come to my understanding that, rather than taking legal action against Ridglan Farms for these alleged offenses, efforts have instead been focused on prosecuting individuals who have attempted to rescue these animals.

I respectfully urge you to reconsider the approach taken towards Ridglan Farms and to prioritize the welfare of the thousands of dogs allegedly affected by these practices. It is my sincere hope that through your leadership, effective measures will be taken to address and halt these concerning activities.

Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Jordan

I think it is admirable you have decided to drop the charges against those who rescued suffering animals from Ridglan Farms.

I have spent 5 years of my life completing a PhD which would give me a 6 figure salary in a pharmaceutical company. However the cruelty with which animals experiments are run in this industry is repulsive and I am only completing my PhD for posterity as this point, with no desire to pursue a career in this perverted field.

If these experiments which are run every day on animals were run on humans in the modern day, even if for the "greater good", no one would stand for it. And yet we dont extend this mercy to other living beings, who are sentient, feel physical and emotional pains, even though these are the qualities which merit kindness and compassion to fellow humans.

I deeply admire your office taking a stand for kindness instead of siding with the corporate dollar. The world is a slightly less dark place now thanks to you.

P.S: I just got hung up on by someone in your office, i also have a disability that is just sad. Also do you understand the FBI got involved in the Envigo case in VA and at this rate it will happen with Ridglan Farms and the fact your ignoring factual evidence is not a good look for your office. Especially because this case and those beagles and that footage have now gone global.

I am writing to you because proven criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped immediately. Over many decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

This is not only illegal but also a totally unacceptable and needless practice within today's society where it is fully recognised that alternative methods, other than animal experimentation, produce far more reliable results and are now widely used.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

I'm writing to express serious concerns that criminal animal cruelty at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is not being tackled. For many years the company has been breeding dogs for experimentation purposes and during that time Ridglan has been witnessed contravening state laws relating to animal abuse. These include...


  *   Surgical procedures without pain relief and without any veterinary professionals being present

  *   Confinement (often solitary) in small metal cages, which leads to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Inadequate and improper flooring and housing, leading directly to causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Yet, instead of prosecuting Ridglan for such offences, you have prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Where is your moral compass? How can you possibly justify such a total inversion of natural justice?

You should not be letting any animals in your county to have criminal abuse inflicted on them.

It's time to do your job and prosecute Ridglan farms, not the animal rescuers.

Certainly, here is the revised text with the emphasized characteristics:

"Across the planet, the movement to shut down facilities that breed animals for laboratory experiments is growing. I have decided to write because I have deep concerns that the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be halted. The dogs bred by this company for experimentation endure brutalities, some are beaten, subjected to all sorts of diseases. This violence and neglect violate the principles of animal welfare. Ridglan Farms has flagrantly violated several state laws:

- Performing surgical mutilations without the presence of anesthetics or veterinarians;
- Confining animals in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to severe psychological trauma for the dogs;
- Providing improper flooring and housing, causing injuries to their feet and infections in puppies.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these violations, you have targeted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to suffer criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not the animal rescuers.

We are in the 21st century, and various forms of laboratory testing have been developed that do not involve violence against sentient, social beings who have feelings and express them. In fact, the violence inflicted on animals in laboratories is not in line with science. It does not progress, and the response of an animal cannot be compared to that of a human being. At the very least, it is BAD (in every sense) science, involving mistreatment, deprivation, and death of animals.

Let us be rational and just!
Let us be compassionate!
Building a better world depends on our actions.
Please, do the right thing. Close down this hell called Ridglan Farms.
Thank you!
Respectfully,
Renato da Costa"

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. For over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

As someone who cares deeply about dogs, and myself have a dog whose life is a stark difference to the one endured by those trapped at Ridglan Farms, I'm appalled and heartbroken that this cruelty is allowed to continue with zero consequences.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Dear DA Ismael Ozanne,

I have written to express my disheartenment after learning of the disturbing abuse of dogs occurring at Ridglan Farms, which has been documented through undercover investigations and by the USDA.

It concerns me that you have chosen to prosecute rescuers who helped to expose the disturbing activities occurring at this facility and help dogs in desperate need of veterinary attention, as opposed to holding this business accountable. I am deeply concerned by this unethical decision and I urge you to immediately prosecute Ridglan farms to the fullest extent of the law.

Sincerely,

Dr. Fateh Sidhu

Hello,

Can you please respond to the many requests to look into Ridglan farms animal abuses?
May we know why the D.A. office is not prosecuting the culprits of these crimes, where there is ample and legitimate evidence to prove the crimes?

Why are you not doing your job to protect those who are most vulnerable and prosecuting those who violate federal law?

We look forward to hearing from you.

I became aware that Ridgeland Farms, (which should not be called a farm ) is profiting off the extreme confinement of beagles, who are friendly dogs.
I have seen documented evidence in videos of just such abuse. Rather than prosecute people who care about the dogs and want to rehome them, I would suggest strongly that you Investigate and prosecute the ones committing the crime of animal abuse.

I have read about and seen disturbing footage of the hundreds of beagles bred at Ridglan Farms: dogs in small wire cages, untreated injuries, no exercise, no stimulation, overpowering stench of feces and urine....Guessing that dog lovers would agree that is no way they treat their own dogs...and would agree it's abject cruelty.

I realize that the DA dropped the case so that the defendants could not present, in their testimony, the wicked treatment of these dogs and the horrific experiments and death awaiting them at such corporations as Pfizer.  There would be public outcry.

It's past time that Wisconsin investigate the cruelty at Ridglan and prosecute the real villains in this case - the people who make huge profits off the suffering of thousands of beagles who are born in misery and die horrible deaths.

Thank you.

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I have been made aware of the animal cruelty practices taking place in Dane County at Ridglan Farms.

These beagles (warm kind dogs with personalities and the desire to be loved and cared for ) are being abused and this must be stopped.

Over many decades, the company has been breeding innocent dogs for brutal experiments. I can not imagine the despair and suffering they are enduring on a continuous basis.

It can be stopped.

Ridglan Farms has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws such as:


  *
surgical mutilations without anesthetics or a vet present (they cry just like humans)
  *
confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement
  *
improper flooring and conditions leading to an entire life of pain and suffering


 Courageous people have tried to help by getting some of the dogs out of this life of misery and they were persecuted.

It should be the Ridglan Farms who is investigated and shut down to stop this practice.

This is 2024 and as a county and human race we a re evolved beyond these practices. The general public does not want to see dogs tortured.

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.

Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal resucue.

Thank you,

Dear District Attorney Ozzane,

I am a Madison resident and I served for 6 years as the Legislative Analyst for the Madison Common Council. In that role, you and I had a chance to collaborate on an anti-gun violence initiative.  I enjoyed the opportunity to meet you through that process.

I have recently been made aware of a Class A purpose bred beagle dealer in Dane County, called Ridglan Farms, which has roughly 3000 dogs on site. A private pet owner would be charged with animal abuse. We must hold this facility responsible for the crimes they are committing.  I am grateful that the charges against the activists who brought this situation to light have been dropped recently, but the on-going issues at the facility must be addressed.

A similar facility, Envigo in Virginia, was closed after members of Congress expressed concerns about the USDA's failure to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. It took public outcry and lawmakers outside the USDA to expose that facility and the inhumane conditions and neglect. A similar type of investigation needs to be considered for the Ridglan facility in our own backyard.

I understand the complexities of the issue of using animals for research, but we must do better. It is my understanding that this facility falls under regulation of both the USDA, as well as Wisconsin DATCP.  Inspections by state and federal inspectors observed many concerning conditions including: Many adult dogs stacked in cages with mesh flooring, dogs not being removed from enclosure for exercise, dogs not provided any outdoor enclosures, several dogs being treated for health problems, many dogs displaying prominent stereotypical behaviors (circling, pacing, wall bouncing) -- symptoms of severe stress.  What is unclear is how this facility continues to operate with impunity with noted violations that have continued over many years.

Dane County is a leader on many important matters--we cannot allow these innocent animals to suffer in inhumane conditions.  I ask you to please consider an independent investigation of Ridglan Farms.

Sincerely,

Heather Allen

It is time for you to turn in your resignation if you believe it is appropriate for you to show up to a hearing and sit WITH Ridglan Farms! That place is nothing more than an undercover animal abuse facility and those who own it need to be in jail. A fitting 2x4 foot cell would be appropriate. They are breaking laws on a daily basis and you find NOTHING wrong with that?! I honestly don’t know how you all sleep at night.

 VETERINARIANS OATH:

            “Being admitted to the profession of veterinary medicine, I solemnly swear to use my scientific knowledge and skills for the benefit of society through the protection of animal health and welfare, the prevention and relief of animal suffering, the conservation of animal resources, the promotion of public health, and the advancement of medical knowledge.

I will practice my profession conscientiously, with dignity, and in keeping with the principles of veterinary medical ethics.

I accept as a lifelong obligation the continual improvement of my professional knowledge and competence.”


It is unlawful for any person to perform any medical or surgical procedures such as the one performed at Ridglan Farms without a veterinarian license. If any individuals that are or not licensed who work there did any of these acts or knew about them, they should immediately be terminated and justice should be brought upon these innocent dogs. As known these beagles are used for experimentation, which is supposed to be used for the greater good of the species, I say- supposed to be. Any experiments done on any animal is pain enduring. These beagles endured painful procedures without any anesthesia. This should still be considered as they are creatures who still sees, thinks, feels, and still loves. As a veterinarian technician and being able to be the voice of animals for those who cannot speak, I must say that the acts committed there were, and are, truly utterly disgusting and no animal should have to go through a torturous event such as described from various pieces of information on this subject. I have seen enough information on this, and for the sake of these helpless dogs, please investigate thoroughly and again give justice to the dogs at this in this place that’s untruthfully a “Right to Rescue”. Take consideration and help them. Do not let them mutilate these dogs no further and take action to truly for once rescue these souls.

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing from the UK because I am shocked that animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County has been allowed to take place.


It seems animal welfare inspectors have been doing nothing to stop the abuse. The inspectors must have witnessed over many decades, that Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, it seems Ridglan has been observed by their own staff and others violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anaesthetics or veterinarians present.
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs.
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these offences, Dane County has prosecuted the rescuers of some of these dogs. The rescuers clearly applied compassionate morality to save imprisoned, vulnerable dogs in the absence of action by the Authorities.


Please do not let down humane citizens in Dane County or those watching around the world. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescuers.

  *   - Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   - Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   - Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Gina Getty

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. I realize you feel that since they are an incorporated business and are working in conjunction with a lab, not the one committing testing that you seem to think they’re above the laws reach, or that they are within legal means, but sadly they work in direct conjunction with a facility that commits crimes that are not with in legal range. Just by affiliating themselves with these companies they’ve established themselves as accomplices and by protecting them and not investigating further and charging them with the abuse they’ve committed you have now established yourself as an accomplice to heinous crimes. In a court of law the driver of the car goes down with the shooter, and that analogy can be applied to this circumstance as well. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies
  *   Left dogs alone unattended for long periods of time without any surpervision and it is well known that they have pregnant dogs in their facility and that is just not acceptable.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. If this persists, I will set up a party and a hands on organization in USA to protest and advocate for these animals in person on the front lines. I will bring social media awareness to crimes being done here and I am well within my civil rights to protest and do as such. Please do not allow the narrative of your county to crumble for supporting these treacheries, or your political standpoint to be tarnished because the public feels that you lack humility and basic civility.  I am attaching a picture of my sweet boy whom lives at home with me, my cats, our bird and ferrets and loves and play with them all. He would never hurt a fly. I hope you can look at his face and maybe scrape up some empathy for other animals besides yourself. Have a fabulous day and do consider this.

Respectfully,

Sierra Thompson

Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, and I don't understand why these laws are not being enforced by your office.

Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

   This is not to say that in my view or the publics’, animal experimentation would be ethical by any means if they were treated slightly less worse. Not in the slightest.



   Animal experimentation does not translate well to humans for example if we were trying to see if a lipstick would be safe for humans to use. It is only 90% accurate at most. We have developed human cells in a petri dish, we should use this, instead of hurting animals as it is unethical and unnecessarily.


    These dogs have emotions and are incredibly intelligent, empathetic, trusting and forgiving  beings. This is exactly why they are using them brutal experiments.


   Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Dear DA Ozanne,

My name is James Cromwell. I am an actor and an animal rights advocate, and I am writing to ask you to prosecute Ridglan Farms for criminal animal cruelty.

At the Ridglan breeding facility, dogs endure cruel and inhumane conditions. Their cages are so small that they exhibit what experts call stereotypic behavior, meaning that they spin in circles constantly, bounce off of the walls, and bark frantically. This is an indication that they are experiencing extreme psychological and physical distress. They also suffer from exposure to constant light, even at night, and consistent foot injuries due to inadequate floor structures. They have been subjected to amateur surgeries performed without pain killers. All of this is clearly a violation of animal cruelty laws.

And if that's not enough, the Ridglan dogs ultimately end up being sold to laboratories for unnecessary experiments, such as being made to have strokes for hours on end (with high mortality rates), being force fed laundry detergent until they vomit blood and die, and being infected with diseases and parasites.

Other enforcement agencies are inadequate to address this problem. For instance, the USDA does not meaningfully enforce the Animal Welfare Act. But you have the power to help these innocent creatures by enforcing the law and prosecuting their abusers. Gentle beagles love humans unconditionally, and it's unthinkable that we repay them by torturing them in this way. Criminal animal cruelty of this kind must end. Please prosecute Ridglan Farms.

With Gratitude,
James Cromwell

Hello,
I'm writing because I'm extremely disturbed and concerned about what seems to be extreme animal cruelty happening to thousands (!) of beagle dogs at the Ridglan Farm in Blue Mounds.
From what I've been reading in the Wisconsin State Journal, it is unacceptable for this facility to continue it's abusive "business" for one more second.
I'd like to see proof that these dogs are being treated well- or even better that this facility is shut down immediately.
It's unacceptable a "farm" like this can exist anywhere and I would like to think decision makers at Dane County would not allow a place like this to operate.

Please do something to protect these poor dogs.

Hello,

I’m very concerned about the abuse going on at Ridglan Farms in Dane County and request that you close it down.  They’ve been breeding dogs for experimentation for decades and have broken many of the States animal cruelty laws.

Some of the abuses include doing procedures without anesthesia and putting dogs in isolation in small metal cages which hurts their feet and can cause injury.  As we know, dogs are like humans and can’t thrive in isolation so they suffer mentally too.

The people who live here don’t condone this abuse.

Thank you for doing the right thing

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

- Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

- Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

- Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please DO NOT allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. It's 2024, this unacceptable.

Prosecute Ridglan farms, NOT animal rescue.

I'm writing to you about Madison, Wisconsin where dozens of animal advocates are currently demonstrating outside the Dane County District Attorney's Office, calling for charges to be filed against Ridglan Farms, one of the last remaining beagle factory farms in the US. Inside this facility, DxE investigators have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls.
Riddled Farms should be shut down. This is animal cruelty.
Please help these animals.

Dear District Attorney Ismael Ozanne:

On behalf of the Chicago Alliance for Animals more than 3000 members, I'm urging you to please investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms for criminal animal cruelty.

They are the ones who need to be exposed and held accountable for breaking the law and causing immense suffering, torture, and killing of dogs.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and I would greatly appreciate a response regarding this as soon as possible.

Please investigate the animal cruelty going on at Ridglan Farms.

Activists have documented cruel conditions on video for the thousands of beagles at the facility, yet your office spent years prosecuting this same people who saved 3 beagles from Ridglan instead of even looking into what is going on at Ridglan.

Please investigate the breeders and researchers and not the activists who are simply trying to make dogs’ lives bearable.

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am a Milwaukee, Wisconsin resident and former legislative aide to congressman Jim Moody. I am very concerned about the conditions and animal cruelty witnessed at the beagle factory farm, Ridglan Farms near Madison, WI. And in light of the newest information regarding animal, cruelty there, I urge your office to investigate this business.

Many people will be working to pass legislation in the state of Wisconsin to ban medical experimentation on dogs outright. In the interim, investigating this business, their practices and the cruelty that exists is going to be a very important step, and we do not take it lightly. Of course, animals cannot speak on their own behalf, and they have no political ties making them especially more vulnerable.

HopeI hope your office will take these allegations seriously and investigate as soon as possible. I am copying my Congresswoman, Gwen Moore on this communication.

Many thanks for your work,

Dear DA Ozanne,

I’m an attorney, and I’m writing to respectfully urge you to prosecute criminal animal cruelty to beagle dogs taking place at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Your office has received many reports about cruelty at Ridglan over the years but has so far declined to prosecute Ridglan. In fact, your office has prosecuted rescuers who saved dogs from Ridglan, but the charges have now been dropped. That makes this a good time to prosecute the decades-long abuse at Ridglan, including:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confining dogs in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma, as evidenced by stereotypic behavior
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Please decide that your office will finally do something about this. Thousands of gentle dogs are counting on you as their only hope.

Are you planning to do anything about
the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms? It’s a breeder of beagles sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel
confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.

You prosecuted beagle rescuers, but not criminal animal cruelty. Investigators, including the USDA’s own inspectors, have documented conditions that constitute violations of animal welfare laws.

Please, help,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *
Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Hello Mr. Ozanne,

I'm writing because I'm sad about the animal cruelty unfolding at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. I feel really bad for the dogs who have to suffer so much.

I know you're probably busy with a million other things, but could your office please do something to help them?

Best,

KARMA: WHAT WE DO TO THE ANIMALS WE DO TO OURSELVES

"If I am to be a voice for the animals, how should I speak? Am I to whisper, when they are screaming in pain? Am I to be calm when they tremble in fear? Am I to shout for mercy, when their throats are being slit? Tell me how I need to speak, for you to grant them their freedom.” - Davegan Raza

"The animals are sending us a message, that they are not our food, and that we are violating laws of nature." ~ Dr. Michael Klaper

"We must not refuse to see with our eyes, what they must endure with their bodies." ~ Gretchen Wyler

"In their behavior toward creatures, all men are Nazis. Human beings see oppression vividly when they're the victims. Otherwise they victimize blindly and without a thought." ~ Isaac Bashevis Singer, author, Nobel Prize 1978

"We patronize the animals for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours, they are more finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other Nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time." ~ Henry Beston

"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." ~ Upton Sinclair

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing issue of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms within Dane County, an urgent matter that demands immediate action. For many years, this establishment has been breeding dogs to conduct harsh experiments. Throughout this period, numerous instances of state animal cruelty law violations by Ridglan have been documented, including:

  *   They perform surgical procedures on animals without using anesthetics or the oversight of qualified veterinarians.
  *   They are subjecting dogs to confinement in cramped metal cages, often in isolation, which has resulted in significant psychological harm.
  *   They provide inadequate flooring and living conditions, leading to foot injuries and infections among the puppies.


Regrettably, rather than taking legal action against Ridglan for these violations, efforts have been directed toward prosecuting individuals who have attempted to rescue these dogs. I implore you to shift the focus of legal actions toward prosecuting Ridglan Farms to prevent the further suffering of thousands of dogs in your jurisdiction.


Please prosecute Ridglan now! Dogs are man's best friend. They deserve better than this.



Best regards,

--

I will keep this short and to the point.   Ridglan Farms is a BLIGHT on our state.  It is 2024 and animals should not be bred for brutal experiments.  My goodness….this is not 1945…

They do many things that are morally and ethically and more important ILLEGALLY WRONG.  I do not need to list them, everyone knows.

Please prosecute Ridglan farms and close this horrible business.

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing to you today with a heavy heart, compelled by a deep sense of compassion and a firm belief in justice for all living beings.

The revelations of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County have shaken me to my core. For far too long, this company has operated with impunity, subjecting innocent animals to unimaginable suffering in the name of profit and experimentation.

The accounts of surgical mutilations without proper anesthesia or veterinary care, the confinement of dogs in cramped and solitary conditions, and the neglectful housing practices leading to painful injuries and infections in vulnerable puppies are nothing short of horrifying.

What troubles me even more is the apparent lack of action from your office to hold Ridglan Farms accountable for these egregious violations of state animal cruelty laws. Instead, it is deeply troubling to learn that those who have bravely stepped forward to rescue these animals have faced prosecution themselves.

As someone who holds a profound love for animals and a steadfast commitment to doing what is right, I implore you to reconsider your approach. The moral imperative to protect the innocent and vulnerable among us, regardless of species, cannot be ignored or brushed aside.

I urge you, District Attorney Ozanne, to stand on the side of compassion and justice. Prosecute Ridglan Farms for their crimes against these voiceless creatures. Let us not allow thousands of dogs to suffer in silence any longer.

Respectfully,

Hi, I’m writing to ask whether District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is planning to do anything about the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms to stop the abuse and torture of innocent beagles?  Ridglan Farms is a breeder of beagles who are being sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.


Please help them and hold the people at Ridglan Farms accountable for the pain and suffering, torture and abuse they are doing regularly in their attempt to breed and sell innocent animals ruthlessly who will only end up being future abused and tortured in laboratories..


Thank you for reading. Thank you in advance for helping. Thank you for caring.. We are their only voice and their only chance for a life beyond suffering.


Blessings,

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Hello,

I am concerned about the rampant and criminal animal abuse that has been documented at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Over many decades, Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for horrific and brutal experiments - during that time Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

-Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
-Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
-Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

It is extremely disturbing to me that instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have prosecuted the rescuers who have shown only kindness to these dogs. Why? Have you never loved a dog or any other innocent animal?

I adopted a rescue beagle 5 years ago - the sweetest and silliest little guy! Beagles are often “used” in animal experimentation precisely because of their sweet, docile and submissive temperaments. Please do not continue to allow thousands of beagles in your county to endure sadistic and criminal abuse: prosecute Ridglan Farms, not Animal Rescuers.

You wouldn't do this to your own pets at home or any one else's, and I am sure you wouldnt allow someone to do so either, so why are you allowing a corporation to get away with such heinous acts of cruel and inhumane treatment of animals?

Tortured and expiremented on, they have no choice, no recourse, you're their only hope for even a slighlty better life.

Hello DA of Dane County,

Please prosecute Ridglan Farms to combat their horrific practices of neglecting beagles in dirty wire cages. We need to be taking dogs into our homes to take care of them until every dog has a loving family, not breeding more into existence to be kept in dirty and lonely cages for cruel experiments.

I hope Ismael Ozanne sees my message, but if not, please forward to him. Also, please encourage him to do the right thing.

The FDA Modernization Act 2.0 makes it no longer necessary to test on animals to get products released to the public market. Also, the results of animal testing are worse at predicting outcomes in humans than flipping a coin. For these reasons, it makes zero sense for these places to still exist. It's old cruel science and these dogs are suffering needlessly and illegally.

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding ongoing instances of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It's troubling to note that despite numerous reports and evidence of wrongdoing, the company continues to operate unchecked.

Some of the reported violations include surgical procedures performed without proper anesthesia or veterinary oversight, confinement of animals in small, solitary metal cages leading to severe psychological distress, and inadequate housing conditions resulting in injuries and infections among the animals, particularly puppies.

What is concerning is that instead of taking action against Ridglan Farms for these egregious violations of animal cruelty laws, there have been instances where those attempting to rescue and bring attention to these issues have faced legal repercussions.

It is imperative that swift and decisive action be taken to address and rectify these grave injustices. I urge you to prioritize the welfare and protection of these animals by prosecuting Ridglan Farms for their actions, rather than penalizing those advocating for their well-being.

Some people who received this message don't often get email from calieblanke@gmail.com. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>
Hi Ismael,

I'm reaching out because I'm frustrated that you haven't prosecuted Ridglan Farms for blatant animal cruelty. There's plenty of evidence available. These dogs go through physical and psychological torture - It is animal cruelty. Why are we allowed to break windows to save dogs in cars but not able to save dogs being mutilated, living in their own feces with infections, with no exposure to sun and the outside world?

It was also cruel that you let the charges against Paul Darwin Picklesimer, Wayne Hsiung and Eva Hamer go on for ~2-3 years, then dismissed it last minute to avoid negative PR for Ridglan Farms. It's hard to believe in a just system when things like this happen to keep cruelty in the dark and corporations get to avoid responsibility for the mass harm they are causing. It's also cruel because Paul, Wayne, and Eva had to live in fear and had unnecessary expenses they had to pay for this when all they did was save suffering animals from animal cruelty!

I hope you will look at the evidence provided to you & prosecute Ridglan Farms for their animal cruelty. It's the right thing to do. And if you won't, I'd like to understand why not.

Thank you,
Calie Blanke

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

We favor animals over all, and we don't favor folks that punish people who rescue animals from horrific, abusive, abysmal situations. We also don't favor folks who let abusive companies like Ridglan Farms get off scot free with their horrific animal torture and abuse.

Hi,


I am writing because I have grave concerns that criminal animal abuse is being ignored in Dane County, specifically at Ridglan Farms. I learned that your office has prosecuted the rescuers of beagles from that abusive dog factory farm, but has done nothing about the abuse taking place at Ridglan Farms itself. What Ridglan does is on par with animal abuse in the notorious Yulin Festival in China. Dogs are confined in tiny cages with wire flooring which hurts their paws, mutilated and barely kept alive only to “look forward to” excruciating experiments that I can only call sadistic, and further mutilations, vivisection and eventual murder. Any such action by an individual would absolutely constitute animal cruelty. And yet it is allowed to happen on the US soil and on a huge scale. The USDA’s own inspectors have documented conditions that constitute violations of animal welfare laws. Why is the DA doing nothing about it and allowing this to continue to happen? You could be a hero for millions of Americans who are vehemently against cruelty to dogs and yet you are choosing to defend a heartless corporation. Most Americans are disgusted by the idea of hurting dogs. How is this OK with you?

Please prosecute the true villain here - Ridglan Farms.


Regards,

Andy Oliviera

This email is in regard to the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  It must be seriously addressed, and put to a top.  This company has been breeding dogs that are used in torturous experiments and they are in violation of state animal cruelty laws, including these:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

You have chosen to prosecte the dog's rescuers rather than prosecuting the criminal abusers.  It's time to stop the suffering of thousands of dogs in Dane County.  They ahve endureed criminal abuse for far too long, and it must stop now.  The bottom line:  Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescuers.

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:



  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Good afternoon,

You are hearing from me today because I have grave concerns over the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. These horrific and illegal acts must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Good morning, I wanted to know if there are any steps being taken, or that are planned to be taken, against Ridgland Farms for their ongoing treatment of animals in violation of 951.02?   Has any investigation been done by your office?

I’m curious if your office has taken the position that the treatment of the animals at Ridgeland Farms does not fit the “unnecessary and excessive pain or suffering” threshold under the statute?

Thank you for your time,

Brent

I am a scientist and professor, and a proponent of animal rights. I have spent decades of my life researching the heinous treatment of animals forced into animal model research.

District Attorney Ozanne,
I am writing because I have serious concerns that animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped!  Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments.  During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, including:
* Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
* Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological; trauma for the dogs
* Improper flooring and housing, causing painful foot injuries and infections in puppies

BUT, instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these terrible offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs!  Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal animal abuse!  Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescue!

Sincerely,

"The CIA directors are currently admitting once again, that they have worked as "clone streets" "to clone and traffick each child since before birth." "Including the removal or their vital organs for trafficking purposes." "Private sectors have stated the records from around the global network of human and clone  trafficking." "Directors of ICE have stated within the Wisconsin networks as we speak." "Directors Sarah, Estela, and Isabel have said." They know whom they are. As well as their special agents within their Marine Corps warehouse surounding me. I just got attacked with mega blasts of nuclear EMP drone dusd bombed to my entire being after finishing the above statements. I have seen Director Laura and other agents within do extremely disgusting things as well as her clones. Wearing plastic-leather aprons cutting up children and men up within their warehouse and removing their vital organs. They even wear those rain boots full of blood after words. They have been reminding me of this at least 5 to 10 times per week recently and since the last 2 years. As well as other men and women. Including military personnel and their leaders within. They've been doing some extremely disgusting things with children. All while forcefeeding me with live views of it and putting it onto their private live feeds- sectors under the dark web and government networks. To state the truth as well as what they have been confessing from inside and out. Also major reasons of most of their personnel being fugitives. Especially their main global leaders for extreme war crimes inhumane societies, global destruction, murder, human-clone trafficking, pedophilia-pornhub etc... they also use extreme frame wars to torture me with extreme delutional forcefed inputs into my entire being and testicles 24/7. Framing each future outcome while they terrorize me non stop. "Report." "ICE has stated within." "We have done this to every family world wide for 2 decades." "ICE Leadership has stated the truth of our records." "Director Carlos has stated." April 12th 2022. 10:18pm. Just to make things even more clear, I have never been on the dark web nor their pedophile porn. Nor will I ever watch nor be part of it. As has been stated 100s of thousands of times from the last 4 years plus, I am to terminate child pornhub. Once I enherit their assets and bring perfect balance to the new world order. According to what has been stated constantly whole threatening to kill me and my family throughout the last 4 years. "Make sure he's safe bigs." "ICE states bigs." "Director Charlse has stated within." 10:22pm. They have made Trillions of dollars oft of me and my family through illegal creations developments and extremist tech 8 exploitation since they begun to say the least. "Those are facts bigs!" "The Rothschilds have said." "He is to enherit us bigs." "Say Charles's friend stated big." 10:25pm. Stated one of the "Rothschilds" on the records. They have also known that I would never be like them and I am to be safe with the global governments and societies.  "Say it is proven." "The CIA Headquarters has stated within." "Including Millies within." 10:27pm.
"104108 big." "Be aware of where we are." "The Rockafellers did big!" This is one of their warehouse locations according to what they just said. The CIA had several inputs in regards also. As affiliates to the 104108 number after one of the "Rockafeller's friends" yelled it outloud. April 12th 2022. 11:41pm.

All of my above screenshot records are in regards to everything that the US and global governments and their main leaders have admited towards being planned ahead. In forms of hostaging and nuclear tortures and confession through my own brain. Including  the CIA headquarters, the US Marshals Service telling me to quote them as being a major part of within all records. As well as their planned ahead confessions connected to my brain cells. They are reminding me as we speak, the importance of the evidence in which I have occumilated since they begun to take over my brain. Neutralizing it with constant tortures under nuclear warfares. "He's the Biggest one!" "Including confessions." "Say the US Global nation's service has quoted his records honors." "Even prior to the occurances your honors." "Director Donald White Washington has stated honors." "He is to be concented wealth ahead of court Captains." "The US protection services have stated Captains." "As well as the US Courts within have stated soldiers. " "Donald White  Washington has stated within honors." I have been tortured consistently throughout the entire day today. They have been rather more quiet recently. However, the tortures and nuclear blasts have continued to the back of my head. Everything that I have quoted has become true prior to the facts and the actual events as being planned ahead. Including the lives in which they have taken from my close relatives and constant death threats to my mother throughout the daily basis. We deserve protection to state the least. Their descriminative procedures are to be terminated immediately. And they must all refrain themselves from their warehouse suroundings of my family and myself.  "As well as his friends." "Say the CIA headquarters has stated the records." "Director Clara has stated."  April 12th 2022. 5:15pm. They also admitted to their mind control Procedures as many different places of the planet have been named. Including encrypted EMP societies of mass shootings, nuclear warfare, mass murders, implanted diseases, global destruction, world War etc. Including the New York trains and Japan's. All on the government records. As well as my own. "Proven facts." "The CIA states." 5:17pm.

PLEASE HELP. They make money off of me and my family every single day even through endorsements from their companies and private sectors exploiting every single being Including duplicating of children prior to their births and replicating them for human  trafficking and extremist tortures and exploitation programs world wide.

Just to torment and continue their extremist experimenting with nuclear warfare since 2018 after I moved in to my new place back to my parents home. We have all been home invaded espyonaged agaisnt and raped in every way possible since beyond the extreme especially with myself to state the Obvious. They are constantly out loud within my surroundings and are attached to my self via brain warg programs and torture drone dusd brain implant devices. Connecting themselves and their ENTIRE WAREHOUSE which is a duplicate of the "Mercedes dome" more or less according to themselves. Including size wise according to one of their privates on quiet mode to my right as he whispers towards myself.  It feels as if they were trying to kill me prior to my FTCA Claim agent reaching out to me.

The Rockafellers began their extremist tortures and dialogue "War programs" instigating against themselves as they have been each and every single day that i get to work. They began by droning EMP torture gadgets sending shock waves to the back left side of my skull nerves and began to obsess over myself and my future according to themselves as well as multiple of their private reserves. Then asked their psychiatrists within what they should do in this case and the psychiatrists said that logically speaking "For themselves.  Is detachment from your self." "Says their Primary care doctor." "You'll find out whom." Basically saying that the healthier thing for the Rockafellers family to do is to detach themselves from my self as well as my family due to the Obvious obsessive compulsive behavioral health against ourselves.  "Good luck in court.  The Rockers did." Said one of "themselves" within their facility while an older man is EMPd right behind me to my right as being one of their family members also one of the main instigators as of recent "years" according to themselves.  They have also continued to force emotional feelings towards their daughters "and grand children" within just about every single day for years since after they began especially within the last couple of months. Including marriage.  "Fuck you spik!" "Say the Rockers said. " The doctors within also recommended that they take deep breathes and to use cirums so that they can relax from their psychosis statement of mind. "Psychotic soldiers. " "Say the States reps did." I have been trying to do the same thing while they constantly attack my emotional thought process including my lungs to make things that much worst. "They bring their psychologists and main doctors within soldiers. " "To ensure their safety soldiers. " "Even Cuban's primary care doctor soldiers. " March 23rd 2021. "Good luck in court soldiers. " "Say witness protection states." Said a women's voice in the background behind a computer..They continue to take turns droning different shock wave Explosive devices to my insides including my liver as well as my head. March 23rd 2021. 19:54.

One of the CIA women within just stated in the background as I continue to be tortured infront of everyone within. saying  "He's  being surrounded soldiers. " "Being hostaged and tortured against his will." Then I was told to write it down to state the Obvious by one of their private reserve. March 23rd 2021. 20:52.

There have been many death threats to everyone within Including the destruction of "Infinite worlds" by multiple men within Including the Rothschilds family.  "Until his rescue arrives pigs!" Death threats Including federal reserves within Including CIA and witness protection. "For not sending his rescue pigs!" Both being bribed within according to their private reserve as well  as multiple men and women within. "They're threatening to destroy both Incient civilizations soldiers. " "Say the Airforce 1 did." "As well as Special Ops soldiers. " March 23rd 2021. 20:57. "That's a Major threat to both worlds Including our own." "The CIA states."

They're making me feel miserable beyond the extreme today while my tortures continue to be uninterrupted and added agaisnt my self. The chest devices have been bipolarly altered up and down within their synthesizeing programs beyond the extreme level of tortures in connections to the head brain liver and heart devices all at once. "Including Trump droning nukes to his head." "As well as his kids." "Say the CIA states." "They're both recorded within soldiers. " "As well as ours." "The U.S. Marshall Service states soldiers. " March 23rd 2021. 21:56.

As of the last 2 minutes plus, live views of Melania Trump in the background sitting down behind a white wooden desk wearing a Red Velvet business suit and matching  skirt droning multiple explosions EMP'd from my body to my head multiple times. "As well as her clone dusd soldiers m" "The U.S. Special Services soldiers. " "As well as the FBI." "Say director in chief did." Say is currently saying "You'll find out who." multiple times meaning you'll find out "Why" as they switch their dialogue onto their private live sectors for mistrackable circumstances. "They're both fucked soldiers. " "As well as ourselves "Says the U.S. Marshall." "Say they're onto us." "Says Melania Trump did." Says the same image of herself right behind me not even 5 feet away as i write this quoted message inside the upstairs womens bathrooms of my work place at the Mechanic area. "They have both pin pointed Jose. " "Says the U.S. Marshall Service." "As well as the CIA  soldiers." "You know whom soldiers. " "Says Ivan soldiers. " March 23rd 2021. 22:25.

 According to themselves as well as everyone else whom has previously admitted to it, the main reason they began to torture me is to get their business assets boosted by the Rockafeller as well as the Rothschilds. Including major asset owners such as Jeff  Bezos Mark Cuban as well as Trump and the old men from Hollywood.  "They're onto all of us spik." "You'll know who." "Says the Rothschilds friend did." 22:28. Please send rescue from their psychotic hostage programs of extremist attacks. You know what is planned and what has continued to occur world wide. To say the least. 22:29.

"WE PIGGED OUR PEGGIE ROTHSCHILD JOB!" "AS WELL AS PEGGIE ROCKEFELLERS." "Say the Rothschilds did!" "Guarantee you they're both dead after court." "Say the Rothschild friend did." They insisted that i write down their names since 10:47pm. and kept on reminding me saying they're in connections to "Betty Crockers friends" as well as "Betty White." "You'll find out whom." "Say Peggie Rockafeller did." March 23rd 2021. 22:59. "They're yours jose." "Your welcome!" "The Rothschilds did." 23:00. They also encrypted their own forgiveness to these individuals within my eardrum and brain devices nonstop as well as recorded encryptions within This statement. Overwhelmingly torturing the back and front of my head and brain nerves all at once. 23:02.

Between 12:40 and 12:48 am, I swerved off the road almost getting into a car crash due to distractions from the dialogue involving the CIA  and the Rockafellers friends with mind controlled implanted feeling of having to crack my neck as the Rockafellers old friend continued to instigate against himself.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Subject: re: Please stop the animal abuse in Dane County at Ridglan Farms

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,
Ridglan Farms in Dane County has been breeding dogs for animal experimentation  for decades and have been violation state cruelty laws in the process. The dogs are kept in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement. This is psychologically traumatizing. Surgical mutilations are preformed without anesthetics and without veterinarians. There is improper flooring resulting in foot injuries.
Instead of prosecuting Ridglan, you were focused on prosecuting people that rescued dogs and exposed the abuse happening behind closed doors.
Please prosecute Ridglan Farms, not the animal rescuers.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Lynn Gallagher

Thousands of beagles are trapped in cages, waiting to be tortured in cruel and useless experiments by Ridglan Farms.

This company is infamous for breeding dogs for brutal and senseless experiments for decades.
During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *
Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

District Attorney Ozanne,
Please investigate and  prosecute Ridglan Farms in Dane County for animal abuse. They breed dogs for experimentation and for years and years have treated the dogs so poorly, it warrants prosecutorial action. They have violated several state animal cruelty laws, including isolation of the dogs, improper housing (they use metal bar cages) that leads to foot pain and impairment for the dogs, long confinement in these barren metal cages, surgical mutilations without actual veterinarians present and without pain relief, the list goes on.
I hope you'll stop prosecuting the people who are saving these dogs, the animal rescuers. They are bringing to light egregious acts against living beings in your county. The ones committing the real crimes--Ridglan Farms--are who should be prosecuted. They're the ones hurting others, not the animal rescuers.
Thank you,
Emily V.

Good afternoon,

I live in Dallas, Texas but have been following the Ridglan farms case due to my interest in animal welfare.  In my tenure on the Dallas Animal Shelter Commission and the Dallas Animal Cruelty Task Force, I learned that most animal research is flawed by its very nature and that animals who enter the research pipeline suffer abominably. I understand that Ridglan has violated any number of state animal cruelty laws.

Although charges against the activists involved in rescuing dogs from Ridglan have been dropped, I encourage you to look again at this case.  And to prosecute the people who have, indeed, committed a crime - those who run the Ridglan farms facility.


Sincerely,

Susan Oakey

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I'm composing this email in regard to a concerning prove of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

I want to emphasize the company in question with concern, had been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During this time, Ridglan Farms has been observed for violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting the company for these offenses, you prosecute those who rescued these tortured animals for a just cause.
Please do not allow 1,000 dogs or more in your county to endure such deplorable offenses towards the true offender.

Respectfully, Daniel Jeon.

I’m writing to you regarding the horrific cruelty that’s going on at Rigland farms.  Something needs to be done here and this place needs to be shut down ASAP.
These Beagles have been beaten to death. I’ve seen what’s going on there,  and they’ve been tortured and it is  disgusting the way these innocent animals have been treated. as a judge or a district attorney  You  cannot turn your back. Something has to be done here and this place needs to be shut down ASAP. it breaks my heart to see that such a thing is going on at this place and we as animal lovers and people that have compassion should shut this place down immediately.
Please act on this now.

Hello District Attorney Ozanne,

I have been closely following the news regarding the Ridglan Beagle Rescue Trial and was disappointed to see that the case was dismissed, thereby denying the defendants' day in court.

Nevertheless, my concerns about abuse, neglect and disregard for the law by Ridglan Farms in Dane County remain and I would like some information whether your office will be investigating and prosecuting and the timeline as to when that might occur.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Hello,
According to a post I read, this “Riddled Farms” is a dog factory farm in Wisconsin, and the 2nd largest dog factory farm that sends thousands of sweet beagles for medical experimentation for cruel experimentation. If this is true this is not ok. Animals are the most innocent and pure beings on the planet and should never suffer at the hands of humans or even for the benefit of humans.

﻿I am writing today to address the issues at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Over several decades the company has been breeding dogs for horrible experiments and setting them up for a lifetime of trauma. As the company breeds these dogs, they are also violating many animal cruelty laws. Ridglan has been observed by former employees and district attorney Ozanne while performing the following crimes:

1. Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present.

2. Confinement in small metal cages, often solitary confinement, causing physiological damage to the dogs.

3. Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections.

As you can see from the list above Ridglan farms needs to be prosecuted. It is beyond cruel and extremely inhumane to put thousands of dogs through this trauma and pain. The average lifespan of a dog is 10-13 years. They live a short life. As humans we have the right to protect their lives. Every animal deserves a chance just as well as humans. Many dogs at Ridglan farms do not get close to the average 10 year mark because of the cruelty and trauma they face. Most of us have dogs, or know someone who does. Could you imagine your dog going through a lifetime of suffering and insanity? I know that any person who has the slightest bit of empathy would take action to stop this abuse. Instead of prosecuting the rescuers, focus on the main problem at hand; the abuse happening to innocent dogs at Ridglan Farms.

Hello,
As a Wisconsin resident and constituent I am thoroughly appalled and angered to know that the second largest beagle puppy mill is located here in Wisconsin, still running strong, that clear and prosecutable evidence of mistreatment and neglect has been presented, and that nothing is being done. Please hold Ridgeland Farms accountable, prosecute them, and shut them down. Animal experimentation and exploitation is unacceptable!

Sincerely,

This puppy’s feet had NEVER touched grass until I brought her outside. She peed she was so scared. Ten minutes later she was wagging her tail, probably for the first time ever. Unacceptable!  We don’t support this behavior in Wisconsin, and neither do our animal welfare laws!

I’m writing today to address the criminal animal abuse that Ridglan Farms has been conducting for decades (and gotten away with this criminal behavior) with brutal experiments on beagle dogs. Breeding these dogs and confinement in metal cages. Pure exploitation of these dogs bred for experimentation and against animal protection laws. Please stop turning a blind eye to this criminal activity for decades and prosecute Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

Good day

Dear Sirs;

Good morning;
I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for terrible experiments. During this time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws such as;

Surgical mutilations without anesthesia or veterinarians present.

Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological teams for the dogs

Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. I am disgusted with your ruling.
Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to ensure criminal abuse.
Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not the people who were trying to do right by these dogs.

I am sure that you both would like to run for re-election in the future without this controversial ruling on your records. Then the good people of Dane County can make educated decisions about the right person(s) to elect/reelect that follow the the law for human and non-human rights.

Thank you for your time

Hi Mr. Ozanne

When will you consider trying the real culprit which is the Ridglan Dog Factory?
How many citizen complaints have you ignored so far?
You can do so only if you are on official or unofficial payroll of Ridglan, right?



Thanks

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have been made aware of the criminal animal abuse taking place at Ridglan Farms in Dane County; it must be addressed, stopped and the offenders prosecuted. Over many decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:



  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present (example:  removal of the cherry eye gland without anesthesia).
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs.
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

Individuals are prosecuted for these very actions and in no way should a company or corporation be immune to animal cruelty laws.  Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to continue to endure criminal abuse. Its long past time to fully investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms.  Wouldn’t you seek justice if your own dog or other animal was treated so brutally?

I had no idea such facilities such as Ridglan Farms existed until today. I am beyond horrified and heartbroken. For an innocent animal to be born and bred for a life of such absolute pain and suffering is beyond my comprehension; animal research should be outlawed on a federal level. No animal should endure this. You have an opportunity on a county level to end so much suffering.

I pray that you are compelled to show mercy and take action to save to these innocent, intelligent dogs from a lifetime of horror.


Ridglan must be prosecuted and have their license to practice, and business license permanently revoked and removed for their multiple violations of the law. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

District Attorney Ozanne,


The days of covering up the abuse of animals in the “name of science” need to end. I am writing because I have deep concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


How in the world can you condone Ridglan Farms’ treatment of these innocent animals? With so much technology available today, there is absolutely NO NEED for animal experimentation. But, the fact that this company is allowed to continue to torture and abuse these living, breathing sentient beings is reprehensible. Instead of standing up and doing the right thing by prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is occurring and must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating your states animal cruelty laws:

  1.  Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  2.  Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  3.  Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for the state law violations and offenses, you have chosen to prosecute those trying to save them. We can’t all agree that all animals deserve to be saved, but society is aligned in their adoration and love for man’s best friend. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to be more victims of criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not those trying to protect these innocent beings. Please. Save. These. Innocent. Babies. They deserve better.

These rescuers spend their time to defend these innocent animals…. And yet the ones that caused the damages are not even being prosecuted makes no sense.

I’m sure if this was one of your own pets you would be equally if not more mortified of someone harming your pet.


Ridglan farms should have QUALIFYING veterinarians looking after these dogs to provide proper care NOT torturing them.


Please take this seriously, only YOU have the means to change it for the better.

Dear DA,
                I am more than certain you have received hundreds if not thousands of messages about prosecuting this business. I would like to make a small point to you to think about.

What if these were children? What if this was human trafficking? Most of us here love our pets and believe that harming innocent animals is never ok. Please think about the abuse these poor animals are going through. They never feel grass, sunlight, locked up their whole lives. All because we think it is ok to put a $ on an abused life. It really is not much different from human trafficking in a lot of countries. This organization needs to be closed till much better regulations and controls can be put into place. Things that grant these animals rights, and some enjoyment if life. No animal should NEVER ever be pushed to be used as a lab rat. Sure mice and small rodents are 1 thing, but these are much higher intelligent animals. They deserve a better life and not to be sold off for torture. They can run the same tests with rats and mice. There is zero reason they need beagles.

I hope you find it in your heard and really look at the law that defines abuse vs. licensing. This case is bigger than a simple decision. The world is watching what you do. Are you going to side with big $ or are you going to fight for real rights and make a difference? Some things go beyond $. This is one of them.

Kind regards,
Michael.

Good afternoon District Attorney Ozanne,


My family and I are writing as members of the community who care deeply about animals, and are watching to see how our government officials - such as yourself and your team - address copious documentation of abuse against animals by individuals and corporations. We hope you prosecute every animal abuser that crosses your desk, be them a private citizen or a huge corporation.


We are aware of the incessant and large-scale animal abuse going on at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, and we're asking that you take action to stop it. The evidence has been presented to you by activists who have risked so much to document the horror these dogs are going through.


You spent our tax dollars prosecuting advocates for rescuing puppies instead of corporations for torturing them. We are dismayed. Do the right thing by voters and our hard-earned tax dollars - prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal abuse. Please, don't let the community stand by while you do nothing about the torture of dogs on your watch.


We're watching.

Thank you.

Dear Mr. Ozanne,
I am begging you to do something right for the mistreated dogs at Ridglan Farms. This is 100% animal cruelty, no doubt in anyone's mind. Stop this madness and pain.  Letting this happen is allowing our society to continue to use inhumane and cruel tactics to gain a profit. This is absolutely needless and there are other ways we can all work together and make safe products WITHOUT these disgusting, abusive tactics. We can make a change!!
This is your job. Please do the right thing!

﻿I am writing today to address the issues at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Over several decades the company has been breeding dogs for horrible experiments and setting them up for a lifetime of trauma. As the company breeds these dogs, they are also violating many animal cruelty laws. Ridglan has been observed by former employees and district attorney Ozanne while performing the following crimes:

1. Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present.

2. Confinement in small metal cages, often solitary confinement, causing physiological damage to the dogs.

3. Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections.

As you can see from the list above Ridglan farms needs to be prosecuted. It is beyond cruel and extremely inhumane to put thousands of dogs through this trauma and pain. The average lifespan of a dog is 10-13 years. They live a short life. As humans we have the right to protect their lives. Every animal deserves a chance just as well as humans. Many dogs at Ridglan farms do not get close to the average 10 year mark because of the cruelty and trauma they face. Most of us have dogs, or know someone who does. Could you imagine your dog going through a lifetime of suffering and insanity? I know that any person who has the slightest bit of empathy would take action to stop this abuse. Instead of prosecuting the rescuers, focus on the main problem at hand; the abuse happening to innocent dogs at Ridglan Farms.

Afternoon,

Im reaching out to see what you’re doing with ridglan farms. I’ve seen the videos that have been posted on social media. They are abusing the beagles in their care. They have cut out the vocal cords of some too. They don’t look like they’re being treated humanely. Are you looking into this?

We deserve to know what’s going on here.

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. These animals are experiencing surgeries that are supposed to be done by licensed veterinarians. They are instead done by inexperienced people with no pain meds and left to bleed with no one to console them or help them. These dogs don’t have a voice. PLEASE help them and put them out of this torture and misery!

Why haven’t either of you done anything about this? What kind of person are you to allow this to happen? And on top of that go after the people trying to save these animals?

It’s honestly pathetic… if you allow this to happen, you don’t deserve to have any power. You deserve to be the one experimented on, and cut apart without anesthesia, and locked in a tiny cage.

If I was related to either of you, I’d be ashamed and embarrassed to be your son / dad / grandad / cousin…

Dear District Attorney Ozanne:
     I am writing to you today as I am very concerned that criminal animal abuse is continuing at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  Over many decades this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments which end in death.  Sad enough that these poor dogs have no future, but they are tortured at the Ridglan facility.  Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:
              Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
              Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
              Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

     Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.  Please do not continue to allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.  Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescuers.

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am contacting you today due to the criminal abuse of animals at Ridglan Farms, Dane County, which has been breeding dogs for experimentation for several decades. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I have read the CNN story (Who is Ismael Ozanne, Wisconsin’s prosecutor in Tony Robinson’s death?) of your history as the first black DA in Wisconsin and see you are a trail blazer.  Please set a precedent and stand up for these abused animals and prosecute Ridglan Farms for their crimes, not the rescuers/whistleblowers.

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped as soon as possible.

Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal and horrific experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, which so often lead to psychological trauma for the dogs

Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


The rescuers of these dogs have been wrongfully prosecuted, instead of Ridglan for the countless devastating offenses that has led to dogs passing away in brutal ways. Such ways have included dogs being force fed laundry detergent to the point of vomiting blood for several hours until they took their final breaths, facial mutilation to "practice plastic surgery" for dogs, and dogs being injected with rabies repeatedly to experiment vaccines.

Please, do not allow thousands more dogs in your county to endure such terrible criminal abuse. You could end the torture and the mutilation, along with the neverending crying of these innocent lifes.

Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescue.


Most respectfully,

Ms. Destiny Lowell

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I have been made aware of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. These crimes must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, that include:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies and more.


I do not understand why you would prosecute those who have brought these atrocities to light rather than the offenders -Ridglan.


Please do what people of this country expect you to do: Prosecute Criminals and especially when you have the hot evidence to do so.


Do you have any pets? Please! In good conscience do not turn your eyes away from thousands of dogs in your county enduring criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am reaching out to express my concerns regarding the issue of criminal animal abuse occurring at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which demands immediate attention and action. Over the course of many decades, the company has been involved in breeding dogs for inhumane experimentation purposes. Throughout this time, Ridglan has been observed repeatedly violating state animal cruelty laws, including:

- Performing surgical mutilations without the administration of proper anesthetics or the presence of veterinarians
- Subjecting dogs to confinement in cramped metal cages, often in solitary conditions, resulting in severe psychological distress
- Maintaining improper flooring and housing conditions, leading to foot injuries and infections among vulnerable puppies

Instead of holding Ridglan accountable for these egregious offenses, there has been a troubling trend of prosecuting those individuals who have attempted to rescue these suffering animals. It is imperative that action is taken to prevent thousands of dogs within your county from enduring further criminal abuse. I urge you to prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms, rather than targeting those involved in animal rescue efforts.

I am writing because I have heard that severe animal abuse is occurring at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, and that rather than prosecuting this “farm” you have attempted to bring a case against people of good conscience who tried to save some of these dogs from this torture. It utterly astonishes me that it is still possible in this country to use animals as test subjects in experiments that cause pain and distress and may end in them being sacrificed. And that it is lawful to raise dogs in conditions that cause permanent harm such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Please don’t let Dane County be known as a place that allows thousands of dogs to endure abuse. I ask that you investigate the conditions at Ridglan Farms and do whatever is necessary to end this practice immediately.

Ridglan Farms, one of the last remaining beagle factory farms in the US., is committing criminal animal abuse Inside its facility, DxE investigators have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls.

Please do everything in your power to have these dogs placed in sanctuary homes and shelters, and close down this terrible operation that profits from dogs suffering!

The facility is not caring for the dogs. Dogs should not be used and treated this way.

Please help the dogs.

The verbiage below is cut and pasted verbatim from the sample prose prepared by an animal advocacy organization.  I am using it because it says what I want to express and there is no point in reinventing the wheel.  In addition, it is likely much more polite and restrained than my own words would be given that you have persecuted people trying to make this world a better place and thus far let those who inflict suffering on innocent creatures flout law and morality.  Please do better.

Dear District Attorney Coda,

As a national of animal lovers, we should be critical of industries that exploit and abuse them. Ridglan Farms has been found to a massive perpetrator of animal abuse for decades. From the animals' perspective, they are victims. They feel pain. They want to be loved and cared for by decent people like yourself. Please use your power and fight with us for creating a better world. The puppies need you.

Thank you kindly,
Tommy

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am deeply concerned about evidence of animal abuse happening to dogs who are

imprisoned at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

This has been well documented and recorded and includes:


Confinement in small barren cages with clear evidence of psychological distress with repetitive behaviours and clear desperation for freedom.


Surgical procedures to stop dogs barking undertaken routinely, which is reprehensible physical abuse.


Lack of proper housing leading to foot injuries and infections in puppies


Seeing these animals in such distress isolated from each other  by steel, does not satisfy any decent ethical person’s view of animal welfare.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Hello,

Ridglan Farms (RF) has been reported for criminal animal abuse multiple times.

Not only is the establishment experimenting on beagles, an animal that is conventionally domesticated and protected by anti-animal abuse laws, but Ridglan Farms is also physically abusing the beagles through actions such as mutilation of infected areas of their bodies. The beagles are catching infections because 1.) they are being warehoused in small cages with neglect concerning their untenable living conditions, and 2.) they're being experimented on.

I became aware of this information because of Wayne Hsiung, an animal rights lawyer who has legally conflicted with RF but the company backed out of a lawsuit because they were afraid that the arguments he planned to use in court would lead to their own undoing.

Wayne posts on the social media website X footage of the abuse committed by RF, and he has interviewed a whistleblower (a former employee) regarding the alleged abuse ranging as far as mutilation by an individual who was NOT a certified veterinarian.

To my understanding, the State of Wisconsin has a law that allows the investigation of animal abuse of private residences without a warrant for the animal's safety as a protected person. When what would typically be a violation of civil liberties is implemented becomes legally justifiable for the protection of animals, my question is follows:

Why has Ridglan Farms been getting away with abusing animals that are, for many people, pets protected by animal abuse laws, for so long? Why they

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have grave concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. How is it possible any caring human being would condone such action? During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

I hope you know that this is ABSOLUTE ANIMAL ABUSE and should never be allowed to continue. If you had to explain to your children or grandchildren this practice, could you say it with no guilty feeling attached? Do what is right, please!


Animals are living beings with feelings.

District Attornry Ozanne,

I urge you to investigate and prosecute Ridglan to the full extent of the law for reported  violation  of animal cruelty laws.

Among the concerns are :

Surgical procedures without anesthetics

Confinement in small metal cages and isolation cause it psychological trauma

Infections and foot injuries to puppies due to poor living conditions

Rather than prosecuting the perpetrators of animal cruelty, you have prosecuted those who had the compassion to rescue suffering dogs.

Please do the right thing and follow up on this issue.

Thank you, Wendy Hollis

I am writing because I believe that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments, a practice that is outdated and unnecessary.

Government Officials:

I’ve been opposing vivisection for decades. And I’m now asking you to do the same. Or, at the very least do your job and investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms for violation of the state animal cruelty laws that already exist.

Dogs and humans are different anatomically, physiologically, histologically, immunologically, etc. Because of this fact experimenting on dogs and expecting something useful to come out of it for human health is insanity. Much the same insanity as if one were to expect to shed light on canine ailments by experimenting on humans!

Not only Ridglan is wasting tax dollar monies, but they are brutalizing innocent beings. I am sure you wouldn’t allow anyone to treat your dog in the manner. So why are you not taking action to prosecute Ridglan for the violations of animal cruelty laws of your state?

Enough is enough. Take action against Ridglan and hold them accountable.

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because of my concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is being glossed over and neglected. This issue must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal, pointless experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws that you should have been pursuing instead of ignoring, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. This is clearly against public feeling, as the overwhelming attitude is that what is being done to these dogs is being viewed as outrageous cruelty and criminal abuse.


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure this criminal abuse. You should be prosecuting Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

District Attorney Ozanne;

When do you plan to investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal abuse?
They are known to be in violation of State animal cruelty laws.
Stop prosecuting people who are trying to stop the cruelty.
If your office was doing its job, concerned citizens would not have to resort to rescuing the victims of cruelty.

I wanted to voice my opposition to Ridglan Farms and to their criminal animal abuse that has been ongoing for decades.
I have been a voice for the voiceless for 50 years and I hope that in my lifetime I will see these companies that exploit and torture animals be closed down once and for all.  When i was younger there were few alternatives to animal experimentation, but now the businesses continue to test and retest when it is unnecessary and ludicrous.  Makes you wonder if any of those who work there havea heart at all.

Not only is this business cruel, but they have broken state laws regarding:
     Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
     Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
     Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

The old adage, don't shoot the messenger, applies here.  Ridglan Farms has been exposed for criminal activities and such horrendous abuse of innocent beings and yet they continue to operate, and those who expose them are prosecuted.
This is outrageous and they need to be shut down.

Sincerely,
Lonna Richmond

Good Evening District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I believe that the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be acknowledged and stopped. For many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for cruel experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating many state animal cruelty laws.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these unlawful acts, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these poor dogs. Please, don’t allow thousands of your county’s dogs to experience illegal abuse. I humbly ask you to prosecute Ridglan farms— not animal rescuers.

Thank you for your time,

My name is Mildred Santiago. I live in Houston, TX, and I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2022. I am very fond of dogs, and have a soft spot for Beagles, thanks to the Charlie Brown comics.

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is occurring as I am typing this email. There are hundreds, if not thousands of dogs that need our help to put an end to their abuse and cruelty. These are innocent animals that cannot leave, and do not have a voice of their own to defend themselves. You might, or might not have a dog, and this is an important matter. Over many decades, Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. In the case that you are not aware, they are mutilating these dogs without any real veterinary care, or even pain medicine/anesthesia. I cannot imagine the pain these poor animals suffer every day; I cannot even imagine a doctor performing surgery on me without medication. These poor animals are then confined in small metal cages, alone, without the comfort of someone. They are forced in solitude and forced to stand on wired cages and their own feces every second of their lives. This then leads to psychological trauma, as if their physical suffering was not enough. The wire in their cages cause foot injuries and infections that no one bothers to treat.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these innocent dogs. Please don't allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure animal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan Farms, do whatever it takes. Be their voice! You were put into a position where this is possible. You have vowed to serve, and now is your opportunity to show your community your commitment to those vows. This goes even beyond your own community. This story has reached people like me, in a completely different state.

I will email everyday if that is what it takes to get your attention. Please take action, and please advise if there is anything I can do to help this cause.

Best regards,

Mildred Santiago

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing issue of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It is imperative that action is taken to address and put an end to these egregious practices.

For far too long, Ridglan Farms has been involved in breeding dogs for brutal experiments, spanning many decades. This has resulted in numerous violations of state animal cruelty laws, including but not limited to:

- Surgical mutilations being performed without the presence of anesthetics or veterinarians

- Confinement of animals in small metal cages, often in solitary conditions, leading to severe psychological trauma for the dogs

- Inadequate flooring and housing conditions, resulting in foot injuries and infections among vulnerable puppies

Despite these clear violations, it is concerning that instead of holding Ridglan Farms accountable for their actions, efforts have been directed towards prosecuting individuals involved in rescuing these mistreated animals. This approach is not only unjust but also fails to address the root cause of the problem.

I urge you to take immediate action to prosecute Ridglan Farms for their offenses and to ensure that justice is served for the thousands of dogs subjected to criminal abuse under their care. It is imperative that we prioritize the well-being and protection of these innocent animals and hold those responsible for their suffering accountable.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will take the necessary steps to address these concerns promptly.

Respectfully,


Timothy Armstrong

District Attorney Ozanne:

My name is Tessa Pacelli and I am a dog owner and animal lover. I also have a background in science and business. My undergraduate degree is from Stanford University and my MBA is from Harvard Business School.

Having been exposed to and educated by some of the best in the best in science and business, I believe that:

(1) No reputable research program or scientist undertakes cruel, inhumane, abusive "experiments" on dogs.
(2) No reputable business tests consumer products on dogs when there are numerous other humane methods available.

I have watched videos, reviewed pictures, and read first hand accounts of the procedures and "experiments" at Ridglan. They are, quite simply, criminal animal abuse. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

- Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
- Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
- Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I beg you to stand up for our canine friends in Dane County. They feel pain, cruelty. and sadness as real as any person. These beautiful dogs have done nothing to deserve the horrible fate of being a "lab animal" at Ridglan Farms - other than being sweet, calm, and pliant enough to be easily manipulated for "experiments".

I respectfully request that you take action to stop the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Good morning,

I am reaching out to voice my concerns about the significant evidence regarding criminal animal cruelty occurring at Rigdlan Farms, and the lack of prosecution up to this point.

Please consider pursuing justice in this case. When I notice people are apathetic or turning a blind eye to the blatant torture of captive animals, it makes me wonder what sort of abuse or mistreatment such an individual has learned to accept in their own life toward their own person.

It is a signal of our humanity to see the unnecessary torture of another sentient being and to feel moved to act. Our humanity is a gift, and it is a strength to care for the most vulnerable among us.

If you have a dog of your own, or if you have ever known a dog that you loved, please consider how you would feel to see that dog trapped in a cage its entire life, only to be force fed caustic chemicals or be surgically mutilated without anesthesia.

There are laws in place to protect animals from this type of treatment. But laws are only effective if they are upheld.

I know this is a difficult matter to face, but it's an important one. The way we treat and care for others is a reflection of the way we treat and care for ourselves.

I don't have to know you personally to know that you deserve care, compassion, love, and to be defended against abusive captivity. I hope you believe that about yourself as well.

Thank you for reading, and hopefully for being part of the movement toward treating animals with the respect and dignity we all want for ourselves.

Sincerely,
Fay Rae

District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

I am writing because of the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County that must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for disgustingly brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed blatantly violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. The fact that you have prosecuted those trying to help animals clearly in need and have enabled criminals to continue their abuse shows where your morality lies. Do not allow thousands of dogs in YOUR county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescues.

 To : District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,
Please investigate, publicly expose and prosecute Ridglan Farms for their torture and mutilation of Beagles. Would you give them your dog or child to  “experiment on?” Please think about why or why not.
Animal experimentation is useless, archaic and barbaric. The mental and physical suffering of innocent dogs at Ridglan Farms is an egregious atrocity, comparable in every aspect to the Holocaust. Please help end the Holocaust against animals by prosecuting the perpetrators at Ridglan Farms. Be certain to rid your county of this horrific, morally deranged death camp.
Thank You,

Dear DA Ozanne,
I am a concerned citizen of Dane County. I have recently been made aware of a Class A purpose bred beagle dealer in Dane County, called Ridglan Farms, which has roughly 3000 dogs on site.  The current operation of this business falls far short of acceptable veterinary practices.  Ridglan Farms should be reported to proper authorities.  A private pet owner would be charged with animal abuse.

A similar facility, Envigo in Virginia, was closed after members of Congress expressed concerns about the USDA's failure to enforce the Animal Welfare Act.  It took public outcry and lawmakers outside the USDA to expose that facility and the inhumane conditions and neglect.  A similar type of investigation needs to be considered for the Ridglan facility in our own backyard.

It is my understanding that this facility falls under regulation of both the USDA, as well as Wisconsin DATCP.  Inspections by state and federal inspectors observed many concerning conditions including: Many adult dogs stacked in cages with mesh flooring, dogs not being removed from enclosure for exercise, dogs not provided any outdoor enclosures, several dogs being treated for health problems, many dogs displaying prominent stereotypical behaviors (circling, pacing, wall bouncing) -- symptoms of severe stress.  What is unclear is how this facility continues to operate with impunity with noted violations that have continued over many years.

Wisconsin is progressive in many important matters--we cannot allow these innocent animals to suffer in inhumane conditions.  I ask you to please consider an independent investigation of Ridglan Farms.

Dear District Attorney,

I'm deeply troubled by the reports of ongoing animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. The repeated instances of cruelty documented over the years are unconscionable. Surgical mutilation without proper care, confinement leading to severe distress, and inadequate housing causing injuries are all violations of animal welfare laws. It's alarming that Ridglan Farms hasn't faced consequences for these actions. Instead, rescuers trying to help these animals are being prosecuted. I urge you to reconsider your priorities and hold Ridglan Farms accountable for the suffering they have caused.

It is very important for District Attorney Ismael Ozanne to act on the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms?  It’s a breeder of beagles sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.
Animals are not slaves they have a soul and we must protect them and treat them with kindness.
Cutting live animals to pieces never gives positive results it only is a practice of cruelty and we have enough cruelty going on in our societies. Justifying torture experiments on dogs is unacceptable and must stop now.
It is more than time to do the right thing and stop the animal torture nonsense.

Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,

I am contacting you today to urge you to investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms for criminal activity involving both State animal cruelty and Federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA) violations.  DxE investigators have documented the filthy conditions at the Ridglan Farms facility as well as the horrific physical and psychological trauma of the dogs shown spinning endlessly inside small barren cages.  Their investigation also clearly revealed Ridglan Farms violating state and federal animal welfare laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing severe foot injuries and infections in puppies

While I am relieved to have learned that the state has dropped all the charges against Eva Hamer, Paul Darwin Picklesimer, and Wayne Hsiung, this does not
absolve the state of its responsibility in holding Ridglan Farms accountable for their criminal violation of animal welfare laws causing unspeakable torment and torture
of the dogs at their facility. It was a gut-wrenching experience for me to view the
DxE video. I am 100% certain that had the trial convened, the public at large would have been outraged as well!

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these hideous offenses, you chose instead to prosecute the rescuers of these dogs. It would be an appalling injustice and egregious insult to the Rule of Law to continue to allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure any further criminal abuse and unspeakable suffering for one moment longer.

I implore you to do the right thing and prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue!

﻿ Hello,

 I have grave concerns that criminal animal abuse is being ignored in Dane County, specifically at Ridglan Farms, a dog breeder.  Your office has prosecuted the rescuers of beagles from horrific conditions but has done nothing about the abuse taking place at Ridglan Farms itself.

 It’s a breeder of beagles sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.

Ridglan Farms deserves an investigation.

Thank you for looking into this.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the ongoing issue at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

The treatment of animals on their premises raises serious ethical and legal questions that demand attention. Instances of surgical procedures performed without appropriate anesthesia or veterinary oversight, as well as the confinement of animals in substandard conditions, highlight a pattern of disregard for animal welfare laws.

It is troubling to note that, rather than addressing these violations directly, there appears to be a focus on prosecuting individuals attempting to intervene and rescue the affected animals.

I respectfully urge you to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of Ridglan Farms for their alleged violations, ensuring that justice is served and that the well-being of the animals is safeguarded.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

The company is objectively abusing their dogs - often to the death - and any animal owner who abuses their animals is legally subject to having their animals taken away. There is no arguing that. People who rescue animals from abusive owners are morally justified and often already legally protected in most cases concerning dogs; there is logically no reason for that same legal justification and protection to be withheld from the rescuers of the Ridglan beagles.

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

Ridglan Farms of Dane County is partaking in many unlawful practices through the brutal abuse of dogs. Violated laws include mutilations without anesthetics and extreme confinement. Ample evidence has been gathered supporting this.

I urge you to uphold the law, prosecute Ridglan farms, and execute the will of the people.

We all carry moral injury by simply living in the current Western culture we have created for ourselves. This choice to prosecute Ridglan Farms is offering you an opportunity of a lifetime to heal your own heart in indescribable ways.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you moved to instead prosecute the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan farms.

District Attorney Ozane,

I am writing because I have major concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped immediately. Over many decades, the company has been breeding these innocent, defenseless dogs specifically for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating several state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

This situation sounds like pure hell on earth for these sentient, gentle animals who are diabolically chosen specifically because of their docile and forgiving nature.
As a civilised society that supposedly values empathy, compassion, justice and just basic decency we simply cannot allow this horror to continue.

Shockingly, instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these vile offenses, you have prosecuted the courageous rescuers of these dogs.Please do the right thing and put compassion and human decency above powerful corporate greed. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to continue to endure endless suffering and criminal abuse. Stand up for the voiceless, uphold the law, and prosecute Ridglan farms not animal rescue. The world is watching.

Respectfully,

Dogs are sentient mammals that form strong bonds with their young, other mammals and humans.  They experience physical pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression from maltreatment and torture, just as humans did when Hitler’s Dr. Mengele conducted his cruel experiments on humans and animals at the death camps. That is why violations like Ridglan’s were made criminal offenses.

Ridglan Farms is an abomination -- an accomplice of the pharma and medical research industries and, like them, reluctant to modernize away from cheaper but ineffective animal models.


State animal cruelty laws are blatantly ignored as unimaginable psychological and physical suffering is inflicted daily and massively on helpless Dogs.


The absurdity -- not to mention the tragedy -- of the whole situation is that the Ridglan criminals are not in court but animal advocates who did not enslave and subject helpless Dogs to the unimaginable, but tried to expose their plight.


No justice ... just the usual understanding between the moneyed and the Law.

Dear District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,

Please prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal cruelty. Their practices are useless, abusive, and cruel. The beagles end up being slaves to atrocious, painful experiments, which need to stop. Thank you for dropping charges for the good samaritans who rescued 3 beagles from horrific experimentation. The public was shocked to hear about the dogs' suffering and now supports the prosecution of Ridglan Farms. It's time to stop the abuse. Thank you.

Hello, I am writing to the office of the District Attorney in hopes that they will listen to the thousands of people, myself included part of the #BegalBetrayal movement asking them to shut down Ridgland Farms and charge them with animal abuse! I stand with Wayne Hsihung and his attorneys that are attempting to end the suffering and abuse of thousands of Beagles. These poor animals are forced to live in horrible and abusive conditions every day of their life, knowing nothing but abuse in a cage, yet the company has the audacity to say they provide them with good care and medical support, but they do things such as illegally surgically mutilate dogs without anesthesia, pain medication or an actual veterinarian present. Surgeries being done to humans aren't done when they're awake they give them pain medication or anesthesia. They don't just cut into a human because obviously it would hurt. Obviously it would panic the person if they saw what was being done to them especially if they knew that the person operating on them had no medical training whatsoever, yet they expect these poor dogs to go through all of these horrible abuses that they themselves wouldn't go through yet they expected to just endure it. They can't say anything because the dogs don't have a voice like people do and that's why I am standing up for them and being their voice and millions of people like me in the world feel the same, thousands of people feel the same way about this movement, and I hope that you listen to us and actually do something to help these dogs.These poor dogs will never know the joy of being loved by a family. They will never get to know what it feels like to run in grass and play with a squeaky toy or chew a bone. They will never get to know what it is like to feel safe and loved. These poor dogs will live their entire lives in torture and suffering and wonder what they did to deserve that. I don't know how any human being could allow for something like this to happen let alone know about it and actively do nothing about it. Would any of this be acceptable for humans? If this were happening to humans, would you care then would something actually be being done to help these animals? Animals have emotions and feelings just like people do, there is no actual scientific reason as to why animal testing is used it's simply because "people have rights and dogs don't". Dogs deserve the same respect we give to humans. How can your attorneys defend  murders and animal mutilators? The law is supposed to bring justice to those who do wrong, however in this case and many others justice has not been served. Serve justice to Ridgland Farms. Shut down this horrible torturous and abusive place and hold all of them responsible for the horrible, heinous crimes that they have done.
I stand with these animals and the attorney decedent them! #BeagleBetrayal

﻿I am writing to ask whether District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is planning to do anything about the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms.  This mass breeder sells beagles for animal experiments. Investigations have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air & feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red & swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors all day; instances of surgical mutilations; and signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles & bouncing off the cage walls.

On March 8, you dropped all charges against three people who were involved in a DxE investigation and open rescue at Ridglan Farms in 2017. While this is a small win for the Right to Rescue (and a sign that public pressure works!), it is also a clear attempt to cover up animal cruelty that would have been exposed in court.

Animal abuse is criminal, not to mention the victims being a species cherished by a society that calls it Men’s Best Friend. I am appalled by the inaction of authorities to do their job. But there is still time for you to make the right choice.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at
Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many
decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments.
During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal
cruelty laws, such as:

Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement,
leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead
prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands
of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan
farms, not animal rescue

I am writing to you in regards to the absolutely criminal abuse of the dogs at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which must be addressed and stopped immediately.

Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead, unbelievably, prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure this sick, criminal abuse. Prosecute the animal abusers at Ridglan farms, NOT animal protectors!


Yours sincerely

  *   1. Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   2. Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   3. Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offences, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. What you are doing is wrong, animals are not “property” or “things”. They feel, they fear, they long for freedom, and they didn’t do anything wrong to us. They do not have a voice so we must be the ones who speak for them. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

I just read an email regarding one of the last remaining Beagle factory farms in the U.S. and frankly I was completely appalled and thoroughly disgusted, and very saddened.  How is it possible in this day and age that the people and the state of Wisconsin are still allowing this cruel midevil torture of man's best friend - - and one of the cutest and sweetest dog breeds on the planet

I am a former Beagle owner. I had my Beagle from the age of 8 weeks to when I had to put him to sleep at 16 years old due to congestive heart failure and I am, again, saddened and appalled that you are letting the torture of these dogs happen for years now!  Labs are finally being shut down that have tortured animals, Beagles being the top dog in their torture because of their calm, sweet and gentle nature.  IT IS SO SAD YOU ARE ALLOWING THE CONTINUED TORTURE OF THESE BEAGLES IN THAT HORRIBLE PLACE'S FACTORY FARM.  What is wrong with the District Attorney and the Prosecutors in your state?  Are they being paid off perhaps by this factory torture farm? I mean, what is going on there?  Its unconscionable!  I've got to tell you, I don't know of any other reason that could make the continuous torture of animals go on - - unless you all just hate animals and want to see sweet little Beagles be tortured and keep them SUFFER!ING EVERY SINGLE DAY YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR!

Animal rights activists have been outside your offices and yet, you dropped the charges on 3 people who investigated Rigdlan but that only allowed for the continued "coverup" of what's going on there. i read that the charges were dropped against the animal advocates way back in 2017!  So that means that you people  have done NOTHING for these poor suffering dogs since then and that's 8 YEARS!!!  SO HOW LONG HAS THIS PLACE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE TORTURING ANIMALS?  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR - - THIS IS HAPPENING ON YOUR WATCH YEAR AFTER YEAR!  So, is it that you ARE being paid off or are you animal haters and enjoy going to sleep at night knowing how all of those dogs continue to suffer every single day ofr their poor sad lives? Which is it?

Investigators have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls.

THE DOGS ARE NOT ONLY SUFFERING PHYSICALLY, THEY ARE EXTREMELY SUFFERING EMOTIONALLY!  When an animal spins around in a small cage round and round and round, bouncing off the walls of that small cage - - THAT IS EXTREME EXTREME CRUELTY!

WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?  YOU HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THIS BUT YOU DO NOTHING!  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!

END THIS TORTURE NOW - - NOT NEXT YEAR OR 2 OR 3 OR 6 YEARS FROM NOW - - END IT NOW!  ITS JUST UNBELEIVEABLE YOU ARE LETTING THIS GO ON WHEN YOU HAVE THE POWER TO STOP IT.  PLEASE BE A DECENT HUMAN BEING AND STOP THIS TORTURE AND ABUSE FROM INNOCENT ANIMALS THAT HAVE DONE NOTHING TO ANYBODY.  The state of WI needs to take these dogs out of their torture chambers, take them all to a vet, and eventually find them homes!  THAT'S IT, THAT'S YOUR JOB!  STOP BEING DISPICABLE HUMANS AND DO YOUR DAMN JOB!

Hi there,
I’m sure you have heard this now a million times but I am asking you to shut down Rigland torture Farm. The abuse these animals suffer is horrible and needs to stop. I find it repulsive that this place is allowed to do what it’s doing.
Thank you, Star H.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I advocate today on behalf of the animals suffering abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. The criminals who work at this facility have been breeding dogs for cruel experiments for decades, violating state animal cruelty laws such as:

-Surgical mutilations without anesthetics nor veterinarians present

-Confinement of animals to cramped, uncomfortable metal cages, often in solitary confinement without proper socialization nor play resulting in psychological traumas

-Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

-Cruel experiments on pups resulting in severe injuries to animals including blindness

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these horrible crimes of animal abuse, you have instead prosecuted the compassionate rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescue.

District Attorney Ozanne,

Gandhi once said "You can tell the state of a Nation by the way they treat their animals".


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,

     I am curious how you would feel if it was your animal (if you have any), or would you be able to sit there while this mistreatment was being done.  If you could sit through it and not even whince; what does that say about you as a person, does it make you a psychopath?!?  If so,  should you be in office?  Please think about how your political stature can make a difference to helpless animals who only give unconditional love. 🙏

Please be proactive in getting these animal proper care and stopping the criminal abuse that goes on at Ridglan. Please do some research on the company you choose not to prosecute. Watch the horrific videos of hundreds of beagles in the conditions they are in and then come back and say you refuse to help these animals. Please don’t be heartless.

I am writing because I have HIGH concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments.
This is absolutely unacceptable and morally wrong on a humane level, but also for anyone with an ounce of empathy for other living beings.
During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


-Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
-Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement; leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
-Improper flooring and housing; causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs, which makes no logical sense at all, and I'd like to believe you have more than enough common sense to see how backwards that is.
Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse under your time in office.

as a sidenote, I’m just racking my head as to how anybody can turn a blind eye to mutilating an animal with without anesthesia first, while you don’t need to have animal experiments anymore in order to create drugs but even if you do, there are ways to go about it that aren’t suffering. Most of us have a dog or know somebody who does can you imagine doing this to your pet?

It’s pretty awful. You have the power to do something about it

Several week or months pass and one day your life changes. Someone stepped up and put a stop to the cruelty you experience day after day and you're finally free. Whatever they did to make it happen, they did it. Imagine how learning what it's like to be cared for and loved for the first time in your life feels like. One person can make a difference. Don't you want to look back on your career and be able to say "I did it, I made a difference."? Thank you.

I have just learnt about the appalling conditions and suffering these dogs have to endure.

Please please please set them free and have nothing to do with this animal cruelty anymore.
Thankyou for your kind attention.  I know you have a heart.

I recently learned about the decades-long breeding of dogs at Dane County's Ridglan Farms for use in animal experiments. Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

You've prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. But please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan farms. Would that not be a just thing to do, and save so many fellow creatures from such human-inflicted suffering?

Thanks for reading this...

Dear Officials,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


-Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present.

-Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs.

-Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.



Respectfully,

I am writing about the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It’s despicable that these acts are allowed to continue and that so many animals are being treated the way they are. The county should be ashamed to have this going on under their jurisdiction.


These acts would be subject to criminal prosecution if an individual committed them. Why is a corporation any different?

P.S. if this was human babies would you still allow it because to me it's the same thing those dogs are living breathing creatures just like us we are all God's creation and don't think this company wouldn't do the same to a human if they could get by with murder because if their that heartless to do to dogs they'd definitely do it to a human maybe someone should further investigate because I bet dogs or other animals aren't the only ones being tested there either restricted area or basement I bet you'll find babies children and adults also being used as lab rats

I'm deeply concerned about the criminal animal abuse being allowed to continue at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. This inhumanity needs to come to an end.

Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

District Attorney Dane Coda,


I am sending this to you because of concerns I have about criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County that must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the Ridlan Farms has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or
 veterinarians present

Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted those who have  rescued these dogs. Please do not allow these  thousands of dogs in your county to suffer from criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,

District Attorneys,

This letter and mailing is concerning the animal cruelty at Ridgeland Farms in Dane County where dogs are being bred and raised for lab rats in an inhumane manor. I understand this is one of the few laboratory puppy mills left in our country, most have been shut down for violating animal cruelty laws, yet this one remains open.

Please help put this operation out of business by prosecuting and enforcing animal cruelty laws and NOT prosecuting those who rescue or attempt to rescue the suffering dogs there.

Sincerely,

Kenneth Damro

I am writing this email because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County have not been addressed but they must be addressed to stop this abuse. Over many decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan Farms has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma to physically traumatized dogs
  *
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. If you would not allow anyone to harm a dog or cat that you know, please do not let these vulnerable dogs endure this cruelty. I encourage you to instead prosecute Ridglan Farms for their many documented offenses, not animal rescuers.

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out with deep concern regarding the ongoing criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It has come to my attention that the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments over many decades, with numerous reports of egregious violations of state animal cruelty laws.

Some of the documented violations include surgical mutilations without the presence of anesthetics or veterinarians, confinement of dogs in small metal cages often in solitary conditions leading to severe psychological trauma, and inadequate flooring and housing resulting in foot injuries and infections, especially among vulnerable puppies.

It deeply troubles me that instead of addressing these serious offenses, your office has chosen to prosecute the courageous individuals working to rescue these innocent animals. I implore you to reconsider this approach and take decisive action against Ridglan Farms for their blatant disregard for animal welfare.

Please, let us not allow thousands of dogs in Dane County to continue suffering from criminal abuse. I urge you to prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms and send a clear message that animal cruelty will not be tolerated in our community.

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am reaching out to you with deep concerns regarding the ongoing issue of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It has come to my attention that the company has been perpetrating egregious acts of cruelty against animals for many decades, particularly in the context of breeding dogs for brutal experiments.

Despite numerous instances of Ridglan Farms violating state animal cruelty laws, including but not limited to:

  *   Performing surgical mutilations on animals without the presence of anesthetics or qualified veterinarians.
  *   Subjecting animals to confinement in cramped metal cages, often in solitary conditions, resulting in severe psychological trauma.
  *   Maintaining inadequate flooring and housing conditions, leading to debilitating foot injuries and infections, especially among vulnerable puppies.

Instead of pursuing legal action against Ridglan Farms for these blatant offenses, it has come to my attention that your office has chosen to prosecute individuals attempting to rescue these innocent animals. This deeply troubling approach fails to uphold justice and allows thousands of dogs within your jurisdiction to continue suffering from criminal abuse.

I implore you to reconsider your course of action and take decisive steps to hold Ridglan Farms accountable for their reprehensible actions. It is imperative that the perpetrators of such heinous acts face the full extent of the law, rather than those who are working tirelessly to protect and save these animals from further harm.

Please, let justice prevail, and prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms for their egregious violations of animal welfare laws.

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am reaching out because I'm deeply concerned about the ongoing criminal mistreatment of animals at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. For years, this company has been breeding dogs for cruel experiments, and during this time, numerous violations of state animal cruelty laws have been observed, including:

  1.  -Performing surgical procedures without the use of anesthesia or the presence of qualified veterinarians.
  2.  -Confining animals in small metal cages, often in isolation, resulting in severe psychological suffering for the dogs.
  3.  -Providing inadequate flooring and housing, leading to foot injuries and infections in young puppies.

Instead of holding Ridglan accountable for these egregious actions, it appears that those who have attempted to rescue these mistreated animals are being targeted for prosecution. It is imperative that we do not turn a blind eye to the suffering of thousands of dogs in our county.

I urge you to prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms for their criminal acts, rather than targeting those who are working to protect these innocent animals.

- Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

 I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding ongoing issues at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which I believe demand immediate legal attention. It has come to my attention that the facility has been engaged in practices that could constitute criminal animal abuse, specifically in their handling and treatment of dogs used in experimental procedures. Reports and observations suggest a troubling pattern of behavior at Ridglan Farms,

including:

 - Performing surgical procedures on animals without the use of anesthesia or the presence of qualified veterinary care.
- Keeping dogs isolated in cramped metal enclosures, a situation that can lead to severe psychological distress.
- Utilizing inadequate flooring materials, contributing to a high incidence of injuries and infections among the animals, especially young puppies. While I understand the complexities involved in cases related to animal welfare, it concerns me that actions taken so far have targeted individuals attempting to intervene on behalf of these animals rather than addressing the root cause of the abuse at Ridglan Farms.

 I respectfully urge your office to reevaluate the situation at Ridglan Farms with a view towards holding those responsible for these cruel practices accountable under the law. It is crucial that our community upholds strong standards of animal welfare and that entities which violate these standards are subjected to appropriate legal scrutiny and action. Thank you for considering my concerns. I trust in your commitment to justice and the welfare of all beings in
Dane County.

Sincerely,
Roberto

Dear Dane County DA,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a troubling matter regarding animal welfare violations that have been documented by investigators, including the USDA's own inspectors.

It has come to light that despite the clear evidence of violations of animal welfare laws, District Attorney Ismael Ozanne has chosen to prosecute beagle rescuers rather than address the issue of criminal animal cruelty. The documented conditions include instances of surgical mutilation without proper anesthesia or veterinary oversight, cruel confinement in tiny metal cages leading to psychological torment, and improper wire flooring causing injuries and infections to the dogs.

These abuses have been ongoing for several years, with no visible efforts to rectify the situation, as recent as December 2023. It is deeply concerning that such inhumane treatment of animals continues unchecked.

I urge you to consider taking appropriate action to address these egregious violations and ensure the protection and well-being of these innocent animals.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you require any further information.

Best regards,
Jessica

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, an issue that demands immediate legal intervention. For several decades, this establishment has been implicated in the breeding of dogs for experiments characterized by inhumane practices. It has come to light that Ridglan Farms has repeatedly violated state animal cruelty statutes through actions that include:


- Performing surgical mutilations on dogs without the use of anesthetics or the supervision of qualified veterinarians.

- Subjecting animals to confinement in small, metal cages for prolonged periods, often in isolation, which results in severe psychological distress.

- Maintaining inadequate flooring and housing conditions, leading directly to foot injuries and infections among the puppies.


Despite these clear violations, it has been noted with concern that legal action has predominantly targeted individuals attempting to rescue these dogs, rather than prosecuting the entity responsible for their suffering. This approach not only undermines efforts to protect vulnerable animals but also permits the perpetuation of cruelty under your jurisdiction.


I urge you to reconsider the stance taken on this matter and to prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms for its continued illegal and unethical treatment of animals. It is crucial that we take a stand against such injustices to prevent the needless suffering of thousands of dogs within Dane County.


I look forward to seeing meaningful action taken against Ridglan Farms and am hopeful for a future where the rights and well-being of animals are fully protected under the law.

For many years, this establishment has been involved in breeding dogs for harsh experiments, during which numerous violations of state animal cruelty statutes have been reported.

We are all aware of the dogs that are crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls. This is animal abuse and it is unacceptable.

Ridglan Farms has admitted to the media that they wanted the case dismissed because "In the weeks leading up to the trial, we observed the public spectacle being planned by animal research opposition groups across the country" because they want the public to stay home and stay silent.

We are coming together and raising our voices all week to demand justice for the dogs abused by Ridglan.

Mr. Ismael Ozanne we ask you to address the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms and prosecute all of the individuals that are causing this unnecessary and inhumane animal abuse so that it ends once and for all.

Dear Mr. District Attorney,

I am enclosing a letter for your review in regards to the upcoming Ridglan Farms case to be heard on March 18th, 2024.   I would humbly request that you read my letter.

I must truthfully preface this email by sharing I am not a Wisconsin resident; however, I have rescued a beagle from the Envigo center in Cumberland, VIrginia, in 2022.  Over 4,000 beagles were rescued from that particular center.  I wish to provide crucial, first-hand insight into the life-long traumas these dogs endure as a result of being bred in captivity in deplorable conditions only to be sold for animal testing purposes.

I also wish to provide you with my own first-hand experiences that occurred during my time visiting Madison in 2022.  I will provide you with a first-hand account of how Madison, and therefore Dane County, is inept in understanding not only civil rights for disabled persons such as myself but also implements practices that infringe upon the rules and regulations regarding service animals.  Specifically, I am referring to my experience at the Olbrich Botanical Gardens which, according to the Olbrich Botanical Gardens website, is a direct extension of the City of Madison.

I have grave concerns that government bodies within the State of Madison are ill equipped to handle cases involving heavy bioethical decisions where the welfare of sentient beings are involved- especially considering that I have personal experience that the City of Madison itself neither enforces nor understands the basic civil liberties protected by the U.S. Department of Justice and Civil Rights.

I appreciate your time and consideration.  For transparency, I will be submitting copies of this letter to other organizations, such as but not limited to the Department of Justice (Civil Rights Division),  that I feel may also benefit from the information within its contents.

Respectfully,

The Honorable Rebekah Ontiveros

District Attorney Ozanne,

I have been to Madison, WI dozens of times for work, and I always enjoyed my time there.

I am writing because I have seen videos and pictures online of terrible animal cruelty at a business in Dane County called Ridglan Farms. I know you are already aware of these pictures and videos because you decided to prosecute those that exposed the terrible conditions, but not Ridglan Farms. Thousands of poor dogs are confined in small metal cages, with improper flooring, causing injuries and infections, and the abuse and trauma these animals are enduring at Ridglan Farms is clear to anyone with eyes, ears, and a heart. Additionally, a former employee has blown the whistle about surgical mutilations performed at Ridglan Farms, not by a veterinarian and without pain medication.

Please do something about this. Please prosecute Ridglan Farms for these unlawful and barbaric business practices.

Thank you,
Linda Winkowski

Dear Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,

I urge you to investigate and prosecute Richland Farms for their inhuman breeding of dogs to be sold for experimental purposes. Some time ago, I testified before the WI state legislature to enact a law to regulate dog breeding in the state. I recall facilities that birthed 3 or more litters would be required to register and adhere to certain breeding standards. How can Ridglan Farms adhere to this statute. If this statute does not apply, shouldn’t the state enact similar protections for operations such as this? The inhumane treatment of domesticated dogs is unconscionable. The breeding facility is similar to factory farming but these are domesticated pets. I’d appreciate a response.

I am writing to you and have sent an e-mail to Attorney Ismael Ozanne as well-because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped.

It is completely inhumane and immoral to allow for Any company to continue to violate laws that are in place for good reason-far too many violations-especially when it comes to Animals, are ignored-many laws are inadequate and too vague or weak to truly help those who are exploited, against their will-deprived of every natural behavior or instinct-denied any social interaction or any sense of family-Animals who feel every emotion that We do and have the right to live autonomous lives away from the greed, indifference, cruelty of “men”.
If some People think that corporations are People, that a river can be a person-rights of nature-than clearly Animals should be given this status as well-since again-they are NOT “things”-NOT inanimate and clearly many are cognitive, intelligent, social and again possess EVERY emotion We do!
I need to also add that My Beliefs in a Loving, Caring GOD Creator enforce this ethos-it is obvious that Animals are sensitive, experience pain, fear, love-This is especially true for the Animals We have decided to bring into our homes, who become part of the family as companion Animals.
I am sure You are well aware of cases regarding Chimpanzees, Orangutans, Gorillas, along with Dolphins and currently there have been cases for several Elephants-Happy in particular languishing in the Bronx Zoo-Thousands of People are fighting for Her case-and others that will Finally FREE them to Sanctuaries.
What Ridglan does to sweet, loyal, trusting Beagles is vile, repulsive and a betrayal-NO civilized society should allow, tolerate or support this treatment-it IS barbaric, sadistic and actually DOES NOT help Humans!
It is a WASTE of TAX money-MY money-goes against my morals, values and does NOT align with my lifestyle OR My Beliefs!
Since over 95% of all tests done on Animals fail in Humans-it is TIME to END ALL research, testing and experimentation on Animals!
Many big Pharma companies No longer want to use Animals-like Pfizer, Merck and Biogen-
We are WELL into the 21st century-We can map the Human genome, create 3D printing of organs, organs on chips petri dishes, We have AI, MRI’s and In Vitro, along with low dose testing and clinic trials and ALL the patient data in databases-also computer simulated programs and mannequins.
It is TIME to CLOSE DOWN these vile facilities of torture and suffering! This facilities actually increase the threats of more viruses and diseases spreading to Humans-Since these Beagles are so compromised, stressed and denied any proper care-they suffer from many infections, live in their own blood, pus, urine, feces-their immune systems are weakened and they succumb to sickness and disease-
By now We should know that any facility that houses large numbers of Animals crowded together are cesspools of diseases-whether they are labs or factory “farms”, “fur farms”, etc-these very facilities were hot spots for Covid, Avian flu, MRSA, SARS and many other deadly virus’s!!!
Science should be Humane and actually benefit HUMANS!!!
Human Relevant methods should be used-NOT Animals!
I support The FDA Modernization Act 2.0 that Congress passed and The FDA Modernization Act 3.0-it is TIME that THESE laws were enforced!!!!


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. I am sure that IF YOU went to this facility-UN announced for a tour-YOU would be compelled to rescue as many dogs as You could!!!

Compassion, Mercy, Caring, and Empathy should NEVER be punished!!! Cruelty, violence and senseless murder should!!!! There is NO “sugar coating” what these psychos do to Animals and NO excuse or justification in the 21st Century-

Ridglan needs to adapt, adjust to the CHANGING times and use State of the Art, NON-Animal methods ONLY!!!!!

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms and help to end the suffering of these poor animals. They don't deserve to live like this.


Respectfully,

Our family has, grave, concerns that, the, criminal, animal abuse is being ignored in Dane County, specifically, at "Ridglan Farms", a, dog, breeder!  Your office has prosecuted the rescuers of beagles from horrific and unconscionable, conditions, but, has done nothing about the cruelty taking place at "Ridglan Farms" itself!

  *
District Attorney Ismael Ozanne has prosecuted, beagle, rescuers, but not criminal animal cruelty.

  *   Investigators, including the "USDA"’s, own, inspectors, have documented conditions that constitute violations of, animal, welfare laws!

  *   These include:

  1.   Surgical mutilation without anesthetics or a veterinarian present (which a, former, employee described as a “bloodbath”)!

  2.  Cruel confinement in tiny, metal, cages, barely, twice the length of the dogs, leading to psychological, torment, and, evidence of stress behavior like wailing, and, spinning, repeatedly, in circles, and clawing at the wall of the cage!

  3.  Improper, wire, flooring which injures the dogs’ paws, and, leads to infections, as well as openings that their legs fall through!

  *   These abuses have taken place over a, multi-year, timespan with NO indication that the problems have been addressed (including as, recently, as December 2023)!

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I hope you're having a good day. I'm reaching out to you about the horrific, criminal animal abuse happening right now at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It is unacceptable and it must be stopped.

Be on the right side of history! Just in 2022 another horrific beagle factory farms, Envigo, was shut down by the federal government due to the atrocious animal cruelty happening there. Ridglan Farms is the exact same!

This incredibly cruel and unnecessary company has been forcibly impregnating, breeding into existence sweet innocent beagles in the most horrific conditions of confinement, deprivation, filth and unimaginable psychological and physical torment.

Please do not continue to allow thousands of innocent puppies and dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue!!


Respectfully,

Kitty Jones

District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing about the very sad and cruel criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms dog breeders in Dane County.


Ridglan has been caught m violating state animal cruelty laws which isolate, mutilate, confine, scare, and hurt these poor puppies! All for abolutely no good reason, so why protect these local companies and ignore real suffering with documentation?

Thank you for fighting cruelty,
