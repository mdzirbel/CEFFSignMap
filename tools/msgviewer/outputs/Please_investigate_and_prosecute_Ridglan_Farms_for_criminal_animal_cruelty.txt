Dear District Attorney Ismael Ozanne:

On behalf of the Chicago Alliance for Animals more than 3000 members, I'm urging you to please investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms for criminal animal cruelty.

They are the ones who need to be exposed and held accountable for breaking the law and causing immense suffering, torture, and killing of dogs.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and I would greatly appreciate a response regarding this as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Jodie Wiederkehr
Chicago Alliance for Animals (CAA)
