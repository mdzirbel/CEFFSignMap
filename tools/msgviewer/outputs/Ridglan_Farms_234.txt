Ridglan Farms, one of the last remaining beagle factory farms in the US., is committing criminal animal abuse Inside its facility, DxE investigators have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls.

Please do everything in your power to have these dogs placed in sanctuary homes and shelters, and close down this terrible operation that profits from dogs suffering!

The facility is not caring for the dogs. Dogs should not be used and treated this way.

Please help the dogs.

SIncerely,
Pat Lord
