Dear DA,
                I am more than certain you have received hundreds if not thousands of messages about prosecuting this business. I would like to make a small point to you to think about.

What if these were children? What if this was human trafficking? Most of us here love our pets and believe that harming innocent animals is never ok. Please think about the abuse these poor animals are going through. They never feel grass, sunlight, locked up their whole lives. All because we think it is ok to put a $ on an abused life. It really is not much different from human trafficking in a lot of countries. This organization needs to be closed till much better regulations and controls can be put into place. Things that grant these animals rights, and some enjoyment if life. No animal should NEVER ever be pushed to be used as a lab rat. Sure mice and small rodents are 1 thing, but these are much higher intelligent animals. They deserve a better life and not to be sold off for torture. They can run the same tests with rats and mice. There is zero reason they need beagles.

I hope you find it in your heard and really look at the law that defines abuse vs. licensing. This case is bigger than a simple decision. The world is watching what you do. Are you going to side with big $ or are you going to fight for real rights and make a difference? Some things go beyond $. This is one of them.

Kind regards,
Michael.
