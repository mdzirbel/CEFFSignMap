I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws including surgeries without anesthetics or veterinarians present, solitary confinement in small cages causing psychological trauma, and improper flooring/housing leading to foot injuries and infections. Please do the humane thing and prosecute Ridglan for these abusive and negligent offenses. Prosecute Ridglan to stop thousands of helpless dogs in your county from enduring criminal abuse.

Thanks for your time,
