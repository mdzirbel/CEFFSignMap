District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because of the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County that must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for disgustingly brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed blatantly violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. The fact that you have prosecuted those trying to help animals clearly in need and have enabled criminals to continue their abuse shows where your morality lies. Do not allow thousands of dogs in YOUR county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescues.
