ï»¿I am writing today to address the issues at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Over several decades the company has been breeding dogs for horrible experiments and setting them up for a lifetime of trauma. As the company breeds these dogs, they are also violating many animal cruelty laws. Ridglan has been observed by former employees and district attorney Ozanne while performing the following crimes:

1. Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present.

2. Confinement in small metal cages, often solitary confinement, causing physiological damage to the dogs.

3. Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections.

As you can see from the list above Ridglan farms needs to be prosecuted. It is beyond cruel and extremely inhumane to put thousands of dogs through this trauma and pain. The average lifespan of a dog is 10-13 years. They live a short life. As humans we have the right to protect their lives. Every animal deserves a chance just as well as humans. Many dogs at Ridglan farms do not get close to the average 10 year mark because of the cruelty and trauma they face. Most of us have dogs, or know someone who does. Could you imagine your dog going through a lifetime of suffering and insanity? I know that any person who has the slightest bit of empathy would take action to stop this abuse. Instead of prosecuting the rescuers, focus on the main problem at hand; the abuse happening to innocent dogs at Ridglan Farms.
