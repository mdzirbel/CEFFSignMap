District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is taking place and must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, and I don't understand why these laws are not being enforced by your office.  What is the point of having laws and then ignoring individuals or companies breaking of these laws.  Here are examples:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. This is selective law enforcement and not justice.  Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,

Carol Broll
