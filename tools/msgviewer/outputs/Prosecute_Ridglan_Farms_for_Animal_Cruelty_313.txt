Hi Ismael,

I'm reaching out because I'm frustrated that you haven't prosecuted Ridglan Farms for blatant animal cruelty. There's plenty of evidence available. These dogs go through physical and psychological torture - It is animal cruelty. Why are we allowed to break windows to save dogs in cars but not able to save dogs being mutilated, living in their own feces with infections, with no exposure to sun and the outside world?

It was also cruel that you let the charges against Paul Darwin Picklesimer, Wayne Hsiung and Eva Hamer go on for ~2-3 years, then dismissed it last minute to avoid negative PR for Ridglan Farms. It's hard to believe in a just system when things like this happen to keep cruelty in the dark and corporations get to avoid responsibility for the mass harm they are causing. It's also cruel because Paul, Wayne, and Eva had to live in fear and had unnecessary expenses they had to pay for this when all they did was save suffering animals from animal cruelty!

I hope you will look at the evidence provided to you & prosecute Ridglan Farms for their animal cruelty. It's the right thing to do. And if you won't, I'd like to understand why not.

Thank you,
