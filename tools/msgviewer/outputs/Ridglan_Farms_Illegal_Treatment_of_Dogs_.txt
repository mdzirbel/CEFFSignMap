ï»¿ Dear Sir

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is happening at present and needs to be properly investigated and stopped.


Public opinion is extremely strong against the barbaric animal testing industry, and many people are discovering that this immoral practice is still permitted and are appalled that you are allowing animals to be treated so horrifically.


Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan farms, the real criminals and not the animal rescuers.

Respectfully yours

Helen Wharton
