The criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped.

  *   For many decades, Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments.
  *   During that time, Ridglan Farms has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinements in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these criminal offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Please stop allowing thousands of dogs in Dana County to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescuers.  Thank you.

Sincerely, Marnie Shaw
