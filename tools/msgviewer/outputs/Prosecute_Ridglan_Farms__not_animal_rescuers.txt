District Attorney Ozanne,


This email is in regard to the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  It must be seriously addressed, and put to a top.  This company has been breeding dogs that are used in torturous experiments and they are in violation of state animal cruelty laws, including these:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

You have chosen to prosecte the dog's rescuers rather than prosecuting the criminal abusers.  It's time to stop the suffering of thousands of dogs in Dane County.  They ahve endureed criminal abuse for far too long, and it must stop now.  The bottom line:  Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescuers.

Sincerely,

Katarina Lang
