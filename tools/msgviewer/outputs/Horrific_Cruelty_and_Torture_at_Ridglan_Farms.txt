District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I am extremely concerned about ongoing criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  These must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.  In this day and age, with alternate modern technologies, it is absolutely unnecessary and deplorable that innocent animals continue to be abused or tortured with archaic, unconscionable practices!


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure any further criminal abuse.  I hope you will take immediate action to prevent any animal from undergoing any more pain and suffering. Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescuers who care about the welfare of voiceless innocent animals!!

Respectfully,


Rama Bharadwaj
