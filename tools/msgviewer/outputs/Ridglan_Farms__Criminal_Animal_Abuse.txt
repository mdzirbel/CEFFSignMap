District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

• Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

• Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

• Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I am not simply asking but begging you to prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal cruelty. This compassion driven act could quite possibly heal your own humanity while simultaneously changing the course of our social structures for generations to come. We all carry moral injury by simply living in the current Western culture we have created for ourselves. This choice to prosecute Ridglan Farms is offering you an opportunity of a lifetime to heal your own heart in indescribable ways.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you moved to instead prosecute the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan farms.

Respectfully,

Brittany Hutchison
