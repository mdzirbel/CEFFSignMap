Ridglan Farms is an abomination -- an accomplice of the pharma and medical research industries and, like them, reluctant to modernize away from cheaper but ineffective animal models.


State animal cruelty laws are blatantly ignored as unimaginable psychological and physical suffering is inflicted daily and massively on helpless Dogs.


The absurdity -- not to mention the tragedy -- of the whole situation is that the Ridglan criminals are not in court but animal advocates who did not enslave and subject helpless Dogs to the unimaginable, but tried to expose their plight.


No justice ... just the usual understanding between the moneyed and the Law.
