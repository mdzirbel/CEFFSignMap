District Attorney Ozanne,


     I am writing because I have MAJOR concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped! Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

     Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


     I am curious how you would feel if it was your animal (if you have any), or would you be able to sit there while this mistreatment was being done.  If you could sit through it and not even whince; what does that say about you as a person, does it make you a psychopath?!?  If so,  should you be in office?  Please think about how your political stature can make a difference to helpless animals who only give unconditional love. üôè
