I write today because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan
Farms in Dane
County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has
been breeding
dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed
violating state
animal cruelty laws.

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal
abuse. Prosecute
Ridglan farms.

Respectfully,

L C Tan
