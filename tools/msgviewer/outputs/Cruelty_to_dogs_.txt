District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Dogs give us complete trust and loyalty. They help us in many ways such as guide dogs and police dogs which gives the dogs an excellent quality of life and the relationships with humans that they need. Using these gentle intelligent animals for experiments is both  both inhumane and totally unnecessary. Humans do not respond to things in the same way as dogs do, so anything tested on animals has to be retested on humans.

Please ensure that all cruelty is stopped and give these beautiful creatures the life they deserve.

Thank you so much

Respectfully

Julie Preston
