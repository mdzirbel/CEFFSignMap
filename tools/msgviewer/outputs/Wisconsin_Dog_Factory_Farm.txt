Dear Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,

I urge you to investigate and prosecute Richland Farms for their inhuman breeding of dogs to be sold for experimental purposes. Some time ago, I testified before the WI state legislature to enact a law to regulate dog breeding in the state. I recall facilities that birthed 3 or more litters would be required to register and adhere to certain breeding standards. How can Ridglan Farms adhere to this statute. If this statute does not apply, shouldn’t the state enact similar protections for operations such as this? The inhumane treatment of domesticated dogs is unconscionable. The breeding facility is similar to factory farming but these are domesticated pets. I’d appreciate a response.

Sincerely,
Renee Vandlik
