District Attorney Ozanne,

 I am writing to express my concerns regarding the ongoing criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which urgently needs to be addressed and halted.

For decades, the company has been breeding dogs for cruel experiments, consistently violating state animal cruelty laws. These violations include surgical mutilations performed without anesthesia or veterinary oversight, confinement of dogs in small metal cages often in solitary conditions leading to psychological trauma, and inadequate flooring and housing resulting in foot injuries and infections in puppies.

 Rather than holding Ridglan accountable for these egregious offenses, it appears that your office has chosen to prosecute those who attempt to rescue these suffering animals.

I urge you to redirect your efforts and prosecute Ridglan Farms for their clear violations of animal welfare laws.

Thousands of dogs in your county are enduring criminal abuse, and it is imperative that action is taken to ensure justice and protection for these innocent animals.

 Respectfully,

Ruxanda Balan
