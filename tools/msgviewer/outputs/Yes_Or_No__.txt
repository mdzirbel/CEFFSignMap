District Attorney Ozanne,

Criminal animal abuses are in fact happening at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, so they must be stopped as soon as possible!


Or do you support laws being broken and defenseless innocent animals being tortured?



Some of the Laws being violated by Ridglan:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Are you okay thousands of dogs in your county endure criminal abuse and Ridglan getting away with this?



Sincerely,

Ms. Gray
