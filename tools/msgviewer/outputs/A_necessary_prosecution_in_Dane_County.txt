Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


Breaking the Law should be prosecuted which is why I am writing to you.


Ridglan Farms is breaking the laws that you are bound to uphold. I am asking you to do your job.


Whatever Ridglan is attempting to hide behind locked doors needs to be exposed to the public, and to your self. Please hold them accountable for the harm they are committing.


And please back-off of the people who fight for what is morally right. Please stand on the RIGHT side of the law!



Respectfully,

Terri Pecora
