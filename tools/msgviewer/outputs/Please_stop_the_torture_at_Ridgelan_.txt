Hi, Iâ€™m writing to ask whether District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is planning to do anything about the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms to stop the abuse and torture of innocent beagles?  Ridglan Farms is a breeder of beagles who are being sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.


Please help them and hold the people at Ridglan Farms accountable for the pain and suffering, torture and abuse they are doing regularly in their attempt to breed and sell innocent animals ruthlessly who will only end up being future abused and tortured in laboratories..


Thank you for reading. Thank you in advance for helping. Thank you for caring.. We are their only voice and their only chance for a life beyond suffering.


Blessings,
