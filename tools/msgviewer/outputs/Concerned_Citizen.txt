District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, the Rescuers of these defenseless dogs have been prosecuted. Please do not allow thousands of helpless and innocent dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not the animal rescues.


I look forward to being updated with verifiable information either personally or with public notice of action being taken.


Respectfully,


Alex Oaks

God Bless You and your staff
