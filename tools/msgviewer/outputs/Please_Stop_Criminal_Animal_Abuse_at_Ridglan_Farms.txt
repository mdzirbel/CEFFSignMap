District Attorney Coda,

I am writing because I am concerned and believe that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and immediately stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal, cruel experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

- Surgical mutilation without anesthetics or veterinarians present (this should not be accepted even with anesthesia)
- Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
- Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these cruel offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these sentient dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to suffer criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescuers!

Sincerely,
Brenda Wallace
