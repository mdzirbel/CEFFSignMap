I recently learned about the decades-long breeding of dogs at Dane County's Ridglan Farms for use in animal experiments. Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

You've prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. But please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan farms. Would that not be a just thing to do, and save so many fellow creatures from such human-inflicted suffering?

Thanks for reading this...
