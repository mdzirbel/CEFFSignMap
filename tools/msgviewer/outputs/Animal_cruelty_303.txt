Dear Dane Coda,


The criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be stopped now. For decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


• Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

• Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

• Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. You are allowing thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. This atrocity must end. Prosecute Ridglan farms.


Sincerely,

Ryan Frasier
