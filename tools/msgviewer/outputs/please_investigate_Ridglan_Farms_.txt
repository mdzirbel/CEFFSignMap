Please investigate the animal cruelty going on at Ridglan Farms.

Activists have documented cruel conditions on video for the thousands of beagles at the facility, yet your office spent years prosecuting this same people who saved 3 beagles from Ridglan instead of even looking into what is going on at Ridglan.

Please investigate the breeders and researchers and not the activists who are simply trying to make dogsâ€™ lives bearable.

Thank you,
