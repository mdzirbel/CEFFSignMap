District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Times have changed. Please stop this abuse. Dogs

are living and breathing animals that have feelings

and who can feel pain. I have a beagle at home and

could never do anything like that to him. Why not put

humans in those cages and treat them like you do to

the beagles. You won’t do that well don’t do that to

dogs.


You need to stop this now. End the abuse.



Respectfully,

Kerri-Ann
