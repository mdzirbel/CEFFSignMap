District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing to express my grave concerns regarding the ongoing issue of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. For decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments, in clear violation of state animal cruelty laws. These violations include performing surgical procedures without proper anesthesia or veterinary supervision, subjecting animals to confinement in cramped metal cages leading to severe psychological distress, and maintaining inadequate housing conditions resulting in injuries and infections among the puppies.

Rather than holding Ridglan Farms accountable for these egregious offenses, it has come to my attention that your office has chosen to prosecute individuals who have attempted to rescue these suffering animals. I implore you to prioritize the welfare of thousands of dogs in your county and take decisive legal action against Ridglan Farms, instead of targeting those who seek to protect these innocent creatures.


I know it easy to follow the rules and the system, but what do you want to look back on in the future. that YOU ignored thousands of dogs lives that needed YOUR help or that YOU helped thousands of innocent dogs?
And what would you want others to do if you were in their position?

Respectfully,

Rottau
