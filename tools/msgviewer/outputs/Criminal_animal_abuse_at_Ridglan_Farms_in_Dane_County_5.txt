This email is in regards to the amount of social media posts I keep coming across concerning Ridglan Farms. The criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Stop allowing thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. I Hope and Pray that this gets resolved soon,


Respectfully,
