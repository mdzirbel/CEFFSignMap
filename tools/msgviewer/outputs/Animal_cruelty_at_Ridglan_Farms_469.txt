Dear Mr. Ozanne:

I am an attorney and animal cruelty investigator.

I write as a concerned citizen about the long-term and unlawful abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, Wisconsin. A former federal prosecutor has reviewed the facts in the attached and agrees with our assessment that criminal animal abuse is likely unfolding at the facility, as a matter of company policy. Please let us know if you can assist.

Sincerely,
Wayne Hsiung
