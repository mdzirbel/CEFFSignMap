Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing to say that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. For decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments, and during that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse and suffering. Please prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. Thank you.

Regards

Sue Nightingale
