Afternoon,

Im reaching out to see what you’re doing with ridglan farms. I’ve seen the videos that have been posted on social media. They are abusing the beagles in their care. They have cut out the vocal cords of some too. They don’t look like they’re being treated humanely. Are you looking into this?

We deserve to know what’s going on here.
