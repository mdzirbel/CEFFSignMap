District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Itâ€™s horrid and unacceptable. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. I really hope you consider the welfare of these animals. I hope you do not just let this get swept under the rug, because these animals will NOT be forgotten. I hope you take the time to look at the animals you know and love and have enough respect for them to help these other animals in desperate need. No living being should be treated in such ways. Prosecute Ridglan, NOT animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Peyton
