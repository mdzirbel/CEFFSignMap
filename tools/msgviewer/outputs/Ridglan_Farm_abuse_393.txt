Dear Sirs;

Good morning;
I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for terrible experiments. During this time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws such as;

Surgical mutilations without anesthesia or veterinarians present.

Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological teams for the dogs

Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. I am disgusted with your ruling.
Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to ensure criminal abuse.
Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not the people who were trying to do right by these dogs.

I am sure that you both would like to run for re-election in the future without this controversial ruling on your records. Then the good people of Dane County can make educated decisions about the right person(s) to elect/reelect that follow the the law for human and non-human rights.

Thank you for your time

Cathy Caswell
