District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have learned of the criminal animal abuse perpetrated by Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


I learned that instead of prosecuting Ridglan Farms for this horrible mistreatment of dogs, which has no place in a civilized society, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Defending a criminal corporation that has been violating multiple laws for decades without any consequences reeks of abuse of power.  Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,

Anastasia Haley
