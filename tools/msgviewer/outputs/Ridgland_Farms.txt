﻿I am writing to ask whether District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is planning to do anything about the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms.  This mass breeder sells beagles for animal experiments. Investigations have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air & feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red & swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors all day; instances of surgical mutilations; and signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles & bouncing off the cage walls.

On March 8, you dropped all charges against three people who were involved in a DxE investigation and open rescue at Ridglan Farms in 2017. While this is a small win for the Right to Rescue (and a sign that public pressure works!), it is also a clear attempt to cover up animal cruelty that would have been exposed in court.

Animal abuse is criminal, not to mention the victims being a species cherished by a society that calls it Men’s Best Friend. I am appalled by the inaction of authorities to do their job. But there is still time for you to make the right choice.
