District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped.


The FDA Modernization Act 2.0 makes it no longer necessary to test on animals to get products released to the public market. Also, the results of animal testing are worse at predicting outcomes in humans than flipping a coin. For these reasons, it makes zero sense for these places to still exist. It's old cruel science and these dogs are suffering needlessly and illegally.


Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Brandon Driscoll-Luttringer
