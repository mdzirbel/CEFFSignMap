District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns about the claims of animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. These wrongdoings include the following:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. I hope that Ridglan Farms will be held accountable.


Best Regards,
