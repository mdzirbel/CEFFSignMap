District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing to you with great concern over the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County which must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present.
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs.
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

These abuses have taken place over a multi-year timespan with no indication that the problems have been addressed (including as recently as December 2023)

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Michael Davanzo
