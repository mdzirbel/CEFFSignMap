Dear District Attorney Ozanne:
     I am writing to you today as I am very concerned that criminal animal abuse is continuing at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  Over many decades this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments which end in death.  Sad enough that these poor dogs have no future, but they are tortured at the Ridglan facility.  Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:
              Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
              Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
              Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

     Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.  Please do not continue to allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.  Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescuers.

Sincerely,
Judith Embry
