Good afternoon District Attorney Ozanne,


My family and I are writing as members of the community who care deeply about animals, and are watching to see how our government officials - such as yourself and your team - address copious documentation of abuse against animals by individuals and corporations. We hope you prosecute every animal abuser that crosses your desk, be them a private citizen or a huge corporation.


We are aware of the incessant and large-scale animal abuse going on at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, and we're asking that you take action to stop it. The evidence has been presented to you by activists who have risked so much to document the horror these dogs are going through.


You spent our tax dollars prosecuting advocates for rescuing puppies instead of corporations for torturing them. We are dismayed. Do the right thing by voters and our hard-earned tax dollars - prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal abuse. Please, don't let the community stand by while you do nothing about the torture of dogs on your watch.


We're watching.

Thank you.
