District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I am appalled by your lack of interest in stopping the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. As you know, over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, including

* Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
* Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
* Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you attempted to prosecute the rescuers of these dogs. Indeed, you would have, if Ridglan themselves had not requested the case be dropped, because they did not want the full scale of their crimes revealed during the course of the trial.

Mr. Ozanne, it is time for your to do your job. Thousands of dogs in Dane County are enduring criminal abuse, right now. Your are morally and ethically obligated to prosecute Ridglan Farms for their decades-long crime spree.

Respectfully,

Edward Macan
