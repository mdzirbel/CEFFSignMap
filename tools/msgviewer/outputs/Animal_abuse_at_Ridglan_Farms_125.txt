District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because of the criminal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. For many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for  awful experiments. It make me sick to my stomach to think what they have done to these dogs.

Don't prosecute the rescuers for doing the right thing! Prosecute Ridglan Farms for performing surgery on these dogs without anesthetics or having a veterinarian present.

Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws.

You must not own dogs or you would feel differently.

Respectfully,

Terri Sorrell
