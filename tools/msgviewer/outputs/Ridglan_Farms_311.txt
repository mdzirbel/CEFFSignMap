District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. How is it possible any caring human being would condone such action? During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


I hope you know that this is ABSOLUTE ANIMAL ABUSE and should never be allowed to continue. If you had to explain to your children or grandchildren this practice, could you say it with no guilty feeling attached? Do what is right, please!


Animals are living beings with feelings.


Sincerely,

Michele Nordenskiold
