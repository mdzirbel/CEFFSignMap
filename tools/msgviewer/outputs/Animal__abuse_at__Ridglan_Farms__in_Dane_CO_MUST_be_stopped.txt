District Attorney Ozanne:


Our family is, deeply, concerned because we have concerns that, criminal, animal, abuse at "Ridglan Farms" in Dane County MUST be addressed, and, stopped! Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for, brutal, experiments! During that time, "Ridglan" has been observed violating, state, animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present!

  *   Confinement in small, metal, cages, in, solitary, confinement, leading to, psychological, trauma for the dogs!

  *   Improper flooring, and, housing, causing, foot, injuries and, infections, in puppies!


Instead of prosecuting "Ridglan" for these offenses, you have instead, prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs! PLEASE do NOT allow thousands of dogs, in your county, to endure criminal, and unconscionable, abuse! Prosecute "Ridglan Farms", NOT, animal, rescue!


Respectfully,


DIANE M.KASTEL AND FAMILY

MILWAUKEE, WI
