District Attorneyâ€™s office,

I am very concerned about the ongoing criminal animal abuse at the dog breeding facility Ridglan Farms in Dane County.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure this ongoing criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,
