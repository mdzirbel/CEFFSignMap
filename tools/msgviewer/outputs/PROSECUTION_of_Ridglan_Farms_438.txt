District attorney Ozanne,

I was recently informed on the matter that you had prosecuted the beagle dog rescuers who have tried to get you to address the horrific animal cruelty ongoing at Ridglan Farms. The animal abuse Ridglan Farms imposes on thousands of dogs must be stopped, which is why I urge you to reconsider looking into this case.

Sincerely,

F. Benitez
