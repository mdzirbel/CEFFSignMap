Iâ€™m writing today to address the criminal animal abuse that Ridglan Farms has been conducting for decades (and gotten away with this criminal behavior) with brutal experiments on beagle dogs. Breeding these dogs and confinement in metal cages. Pure exploitation of these dogs bred for experimentation and against animal protection laws. Please stop turning a blind eye to this criminal activity for decades and prosecute Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

Good day
