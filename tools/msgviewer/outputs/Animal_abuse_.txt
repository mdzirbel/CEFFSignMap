District Attorney Ozanne,

I’m writing this email because this topic about animal abuse has always been something I’ve been wanting to put a stop to. I’m a junior in high school and I’ve always dreamed of my future job to be one pursuing to work towards putting a stop to animal cruelty. What did you study in college and what steps did you take to achieve this role of helping dogs get their rights?

Respectfully,

Juniper Hanson
