Please stop the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. We are attempting to be a more humane society and breeding sweet dogs for brutal unnecessary experiments.


It is recorded that Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


How can we as a civilized people allow this to continue? But, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. This does not speak well for you and your county!


Sincerely,

Lynn Pacifico
