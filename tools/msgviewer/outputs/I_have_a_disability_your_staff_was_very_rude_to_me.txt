District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,

Rachel Kepnes
P.S: I just got hung up on by someone in your office, i also have a disability that is just sad. Also do you understand the FBI got involved in the Envigo case in VA and at this rate it will happen with Ridglan Farms and the fact your ignoring factual evidence is not a good look for your office. Especially because this case and those beagles and that footage have now gone global.
