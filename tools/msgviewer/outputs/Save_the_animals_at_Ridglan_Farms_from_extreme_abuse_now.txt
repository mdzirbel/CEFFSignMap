District Attorney Ozanne


I am writing to you in regards to the absolutely criminal abuse of the dogs at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which must be addressed and stopped immediately.

Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead, unbelievably, prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure this sick, criminal abuse. Prosecute the animal abusers at Ridglan farms, NOT animal protectors!


Yours sincerely

Susan Buckland
