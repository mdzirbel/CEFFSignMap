I think it is admirable you have decided to drop the charges against those who rescued suffering animals from Ridglan Farms.

I have spent 5 years of my life completing a PhD which would give me a 6 figure salary in a pharmaceutical company. However the cruelty with which animals experiments are run in this industry is repulsive and I am only completing my PhD for posterity as this point, with no desire to pursue a career in this perverted field.

If these experiments which are run every day on animals were run on humans in the modern day, even if for the "greater good", no one would stand for it. And yet we dont extend this mercy to other living beings, who are sentient, feel physical and emotional pains, even though these are the qualities which merit kindness and compassion to fellow humans.

I deeply admire your office taking a stand for kindness instead of siding with the corporate dollar. The world is a slightly less dark place now thanks to you.
