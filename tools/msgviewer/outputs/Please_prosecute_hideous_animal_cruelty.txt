District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for cruel experiments. During that time, this company has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to severe psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring of housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead chosen to prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue!!


Respectfully,


Diane Smele
