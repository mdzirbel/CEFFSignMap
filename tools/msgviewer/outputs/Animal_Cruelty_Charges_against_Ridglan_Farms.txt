Good morning, Mr. Ozanne,

Please do the right thing and prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal cruelty.  You donâ€™t have to be a pet owner or dog lover to see the abhorrent cruelty in this facility.

There is absolutely no scientific reason for a place like Ridglan Farms to exist.

Please do the right thing here.

Thank you,

Kaylee Swanson
