I am writing because I have concerns that animal abuse at RIdglan farms must be addressed and stopped.Over many decades , the company has been breeding dogs for brutal cruel outdated unscientific experiments .During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating
State animal cruelty laws, such as;


  *   Surgical mutilations without anaesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement these are pack animals , leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing absolute minimum and basic need , causing foot injury and infection in small puppy dogs

  Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse , the world is watching and are well aware of Ridglan farms please prosecute and shut down this awful company. I  thank the animal rescue for bringing this to the attention of the world we will not stand by while these horrendous crimes against those with no voice go unpunished .
We all must be there voice .
