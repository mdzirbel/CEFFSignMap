 Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am reaching out to express my concerns regarding what I believe to be serious instances of criminal animal abuse occurring at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which I feel require urgent attention and action.

For many years, it has come to light that Ridglan Farms has been engaged in the breeding of dogs for experiments, a practice that has raised significant ethical and legal questions. During this period, there have been multiple observations suggesting that the facility has not adhered to state animal cruelty laws, including but not limited to:

- Performing surgical procedures without the use of anesthetics or the supervision of qualified veterinarians.
- Housing dogs in small, metal cages for extended periods, often in isolation, which can lead to severe psychological distress.
- Utilizing improper flooring and housing conditions that have resulted in foot injuries and infections among the puppies.

It has come to my understanding that, rather than taking legal action against Ridglan Farms for these alleged offenses, efforts have instead been focused on prosecuting individuals who have attempted to rescue these animals.

I respectfully urge you to reconsider the approach taken towards Ridglan Farms and to prioritize the welfare of the thousands of dogs allegedly affected by these practices. It is my sincere hope that through your leadership, effective measures will be taken to address and halt these concerning activities.

Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Jordan
