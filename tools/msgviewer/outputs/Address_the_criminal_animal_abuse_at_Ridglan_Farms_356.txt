Hello,

I am writing because of the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  This can no longer be shoved under the rug.   Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

• Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
• Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
• Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Thousands of these animals in breeding facilities in our state live a miserable caged existence, bred for unnecessary experiments that do not transfer to human use.   Wisconsin is one of the epicenters of animal research in the United States and has the dubious distinction of being #1 in the United States for research on both dogs and cats; #2 for rabbits.

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.
