District Attorney Ozanne,

I am reaching out to express my concerns regarding the issue of criminal animal abuse occurring at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which demands immediate attention and action. Over the course of many decades, the company has been involved in breeding dogs for inhumane experimentation purposes. Throughout this time, Ridglan has been observed repeatedly violating state animal cruelty laws, including:

- Performing surgical mutilations without the administration of proper anesthetics or the presence of veterinarians
- Subjecting dogs to confinement in cramped metal cages, often in solitary conditions, resulting in severe psychological distress
- Maintaining improper flooring and housing conditions, leading to foot injuries and infections among vulnerable puppies

Instead of holding Ridglan accountable for these egregious offenses, there has been a troubling trend of prosecuting those individuals who have attempted to rescue these suffering animals. It is imperative that action is taken to prevent thousands of dogs within your county from enduring further criminal abuse. I urge you to prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms, rather than targeting those involved in animal rescue efforts.

Respectfully,

Daniel Watley
