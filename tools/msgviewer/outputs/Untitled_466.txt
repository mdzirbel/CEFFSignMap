 Please put a stop to the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County! This deplorable company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments for decades without anyone doing anything about it. Dogs are not test subjects they're FAMILY. They are violating state animal cruelty laws. Such as-


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Unbelievable! Where have the morals of humanity gone? Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to continue to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescuers!!!!
