District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I am concerned that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is not being addressed and stopped.

Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws by surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present and confinement of dogs in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs as well as improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies!

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescuers.

Regards
Sylvia Cooper
