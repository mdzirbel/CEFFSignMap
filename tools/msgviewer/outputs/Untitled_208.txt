District Attorneys,

This letter and mailing is concerning the animal cruelty at Ridgeland Farms in Dane County where dogs are being bred and raised for lab rats in an inhumane manor. I understand this is one of the few laboratory puppy mills left in our country, most have been shut down for violating animal cruelty laws, yet this one remains open.

Please help put this operation out of business by prosecuting and enforcing animal cruelty laws and NOT prosecuting those who rescue or attempt to rescue the suffering dogs there.

Sincerely,

Kenneth Damro

DeSoto, WI.
