You don't often get email from carolinevanhaeften@yahoo.ca. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>
Hello,

I understand that Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is a very busy man with a very important job to do, handling domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, child neglect & homicide. ALL of which are so very important. I urge DA Ozanne to use his authority & influence to improve the 'humanity' within the law that must pertain to ALL living things that feel pain & suffering.

It is unfathomable to me when I see justice systems protect criminals & jail courageous human beings who speak up against the neglect & abuse of living things. A just & true law would state that a rescuer, a protector is never a criminal.

I urge DA Ozanne to be the first to challenge inhumane 'turn a blind eye' "sweep it under the carpet' laws when it comes to the for profit animal breeding, animal agriculture & animal testing organizations that get away with horrific neglect & abuse. ALL animal organizations MUST be held accountable for abuse & neglect. Period.

In the past when confronting & challenging judicial laws DA Ozanne requested a Supreme Court Justice with ties to lawyers arguing a case step aside, an act the New York Times called “brave.”   WOW! Brave man for sure.

I ask with respect, humility & boldness District Attorney Ismael Ozanne please address the criminal abuse at Ridglan Farms.

While I write/send this email many helpless animals are suffering, you Sir can put a STOP to it!

Animals are the last bastion of slavery, bought & sold like objects. Living beings are NOT objects.

Thank you for the privilege of sending this email.

Sincerely,
Caroline Van Haeften
