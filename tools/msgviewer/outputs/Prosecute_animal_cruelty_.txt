Dane County DA Ozanne and staff -
You have a lot of power and influence about which laws to enforce by which lawbreakers you prosecute. When do you plan to bring cases against those committing ongoing criminal acts of animal cruelty at Ridglan Farms in Dane County?
Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.
Sincerely -
Anna Lisa Gross
