District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. Anybody who condones this abuse is a monster and you are doing a disservice to the most innocent and loyal creatures on this earth who deserve to be protected by the people who are able to do so.During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. This email is being sent all the way from South Africa, yes that's right the story of your negligence has made it all the way to south africa. Get a heart and get it right next time.

Respectfully,

Nikea
