District Attorney Ozanne,

I have recently been made aware that criminal animal abuse is taking place under your county. Why is the prosecution being directed to those who intend to rescue the disrespected life and not to those committing violent acts against our fellow inhabitants? Ridglan Farms in Dane county has been operating under the constant violations against state animal cruelty laws such as non-anesthetized surgical mutilations, psychologically traumatic solitary confinement, and over all mistreatment, all under your watch. Am I supposed to sit here in silence while you have thousands of lives hanging off the palm of your hands or are you going to do something about it?

Respectfully,
Kelsey Se√±eres
