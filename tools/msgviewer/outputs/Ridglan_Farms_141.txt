District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped as soon as possible.

Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal and horrific experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, which so often lead to psychological trauma for the dogs

Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


The rescuers of these dogs have been wrongfully prosecuted, instead of Ridglan for the countless devastating offenses that has led to dogs passing away in brutal ways. Such ways have included dogs being force fed laundry detergent to the point of vomiting blood for several hours until they took their final breaths, facial mutilation to "practice plastic surgery" for dogs, and dogs being injected with rabies repeatedly to experiment vaccines.

Please, do not allow thousands more dogs in your county to endure such terrible criminal abuse. You could end the torture and the mutilation, along with the neverending crying of these innocent lifes.

Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescue.


Most respectfully,

Ms. Destiny Lowell
