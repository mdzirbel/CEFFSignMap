Hello,
I'm writing because I'm extremely disturbed and concerned about what seems to be extreme animal cruelty happening to thousands (!) of beagle dogs at the Ridglan Farm in Blue Mounds.
From what I've been reading in the Wisconsin State Journal, it is unacceptable for this facility to continue it's abusive "business" for one more second.
I'd like to see proof that these dogs are being treated well- or even better that this facility is shut down immediately.
It's unacceptable a "farm" like this can exist anywhere and I would like to think decision makers at Dane County would not allow a place like this to operate.

Please do something to protect these poor dogs.
