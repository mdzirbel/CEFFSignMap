District Attorney Ozanne;

When do you plan to investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal abuse?
They are known to be in violation of State animal cruelty laws.
Stop prosecuting people who are trying to stop the cruelty.
If your office was doing its job, concerned citizens would not have to resort to rescuing the victims of cruelty.
