Dear District Attorney Coda,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to ask you to consider prosecuting Ridglan Farms. Ridglan Farms do medical experiments on dogs and have been observed to violate state animal cruelty laws including:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

This is both against the law and against what is expected of society and any reasonable human being. I ask that you be reasonable.

Best regards,
