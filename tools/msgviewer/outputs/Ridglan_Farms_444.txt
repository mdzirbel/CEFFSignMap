Good Morning District Attorney Ozanne,

I am a resident of Waukesha County and an advocate for the fair and healthy treatment of all animals.  Please actively pursue Ridglan Farms and their experimentation on dogs.  These businesses must be shut down and illegal over all 50 States.

Thank you,
Robin Brugman
