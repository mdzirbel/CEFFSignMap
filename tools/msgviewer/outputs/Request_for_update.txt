Hello District Attorney Ozanne,

I have been closely following the news regarding the Ridglan Beagle Rescue Trial and was disappointed to see that the case was dismissed, thereby denying the defendants' day in court.

Nevertheless, my concerns about abuse, neglect and disregard for the law by Ridglan Farms in Dane County remain and I would like some information whether your office will be investigating and prosecuting and the timeline as to when that might occur.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Matthew Bruno
