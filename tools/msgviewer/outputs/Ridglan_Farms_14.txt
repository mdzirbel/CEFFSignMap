Dear Mr. Ozanne,
I am begging you to do something right for the mistreated dogs at Ridglan Farms. This is 100% animal cruelty, no doubt in anyone's mind. Stop this madness and pain.  Letting this happen is allowing our society to continue to use inhumane and cruel tactics to gain a profit. This is absolutely needless and there are other ways we can all work together and make safe products WITHOUT these disgusting, abusive tactics. We can make a change!!
This is your job. Please do the right thing!

Sincerely,

Jen Colter
