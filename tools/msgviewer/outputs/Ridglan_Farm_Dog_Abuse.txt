I am writing because I have received information about criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County that should be addressed and stopped.  It is my understanding that the company has a long history of breeding dogs for experiments that violate state animal cruelty laws, including:



  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

As someone who lived in Madison, WI some years ago I am horrified that dogs, living beings that I love and cherish, could be subject to such cruelty in Dane County.

Respectfully,
