We are all aware of the dogs that are crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls. This is animal abuse and it is unacceptable.

Ridglan Farms has admitted to the media that they wanted the case dismissed because "In the weeks leading up to the trial, we observed the public spectacle being planned by animal research opposition groups across the country" because they want the public to stay home and stay silent.

We are coming together and raising our voices all week to demand justice for the dogs abused by Ridglan.

Mr. Ismael Ozanne we ask you to address the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms and prosecute all of the individuals that are causing this unnecessary and inhumane animal abuse so that it ends once and for all.

Sincerely,
Cindy de la Garza
