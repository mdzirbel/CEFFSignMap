District Attorney Ozanne,

I am reaching out because I'm deeply concerned about the ongoing criminal mistreatment of animals at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. For years, this company has been breeding dogs for cruel experiments, and during this time, numerous violations of state animal cruelty laws have been observed, including:

  1.  -Performing surgical procedures without the use of anesthesia or the presence of qualified veterinarians.
  2.  -Confining animals in small metal cages, often in isolation, resulting in severe psychological suffering for the dogs.
  3.  -Providing inadequate flooring and housing, leading to foot injuries and infections in young puppies.

Instead of holding Ridglan accountable for these egregious actions, it appears that those who have attempted to rescue these mistreated animals are being targeted for prosecution. It is imperative that we do not turn a blind eye to the suffering of thousands of dogs in our county.

I urge you to prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms for their criminal acts, rather than targeting those who are working to protect these innocent animals.

Sincerely,

Angelica Rodriguez

Pompano Beach, Florida
