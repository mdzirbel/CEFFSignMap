Hello staff at Dane County,

May I get a response to reasons why animal cruelties are not treated with fairness in prosecution?
Thank you.

Hello,

Can you please respond to the many requests to look into Ridglan farms animal abuses?
May we know why the D.A. office is not prosecuting the culprits of these crimes, where there is ample and legitimate evidence to prove the crimes?

Why are you not doing your job to protect those who are most vulnerable and prosecuting those who violate federal law?

We look forward to hearing from you.
Chris Law
