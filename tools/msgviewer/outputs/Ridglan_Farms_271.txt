District Attorney Ozanne,


I do not live in your state or county, but have heard about the cruel and abusive conditions that exist at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. This facility, in my opinion, should be shut down for its violations of basic human ethics, not to mention your own state's animal cruelty laws.

I urge you to do the right thing and prosecute Ridglan Farms as you would any person or business in your county that violates anti-cruelty statutes.

Respectfully yours,
David Wolfson
