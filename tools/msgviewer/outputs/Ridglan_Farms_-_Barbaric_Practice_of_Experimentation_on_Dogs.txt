District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I had no idea such facilities such as Ridglan Farms existed until today. I am beyond horrified and heartbroken. For an innocent animal to be born and bred for a life of such absolute pain and suffering is beyond my comprehension; animal research should be outlawed on a federal level. No animal should endure this. You have an opportunity on a county level to end so much suffering.

I pray that you are compelled to show mercy and take action to save to these innocent, intelligent dogs from a lifetime of horror.


Ridglan must be prosecuted and have their license to practice, and business license permanently revoked and removed for their multiple violations of the law. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.


Respectfully,


Annie Lloyd
