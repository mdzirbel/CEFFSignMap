District Attorney Dane Coda


I am writing because I have been made aware that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. It is not unknown that over many decades that the company has been breeding dogs for the pure purpose of brutal experiments. During this time, Ridglan has been exposed to violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   • Surgical mutilations without anaesthetics or veterinarians present.
  *   • Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs.
  *   • Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.
  *

However unlawfully you have Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offences, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.


So I am pleading that you do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.


You must take the appropriate actions to prosecute Ridglan farms, not those who participated in the rescue of these innocent puppies.

Kind regards,

Josh Reeves
