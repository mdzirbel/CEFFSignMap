District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing from Colorado. I come to you as a dog owner who has concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offers , you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

You have the chance to change the lives of countless animals that are currently experiencing inhumane conditions and prevent the abuse of future animals. As a dog owner and animal lover, I  hope you choose to be on the right side of history.






Respectfully,


Sydney Hubbard
