Dear DA Ozanne,
I am a concerned citizen of Dane County. I have recently been made aware of a Class A purpose bred beagle dealer in Dane County, called Ridglan Farms, which has roughly 3000 dogs on site.  The current operation of this business falls far short of acceptable veterinary practices.  Ridglan Farms should be reported to proper authorities.  A private pet owner would be charged with animal abuse.

A similar facility, Envigo in Virginia, was closed after members of Congress expressed concerns about the USDA's failure to enforce the Animal Welfare Act.  It took public outcry and lawmakers outside the USDA to expose that facility and the inhumane conditions and neglect.  A similar type of investigation needs to be considered for the Ridglan facility in our own backyard.

It is my understanding that this facility falls under regulation of both the USDA, as well as Wisconsin DATCP.  Inspections by state and federal inspectors observed many concerning conditions including: Many adult dogs stacked in cages with mesh flooring, dogs not being removed from enclosure for exercise, dogs not provided any outdoor enclosures, several dogs being treated for health problems, many dogs displaying prominent stereotypical behaviors (circling, pacing, wall bouncing) -- symptoms of severe stress.  What is unclear is how this facility continues to operate with impunity with noted violations that have continued over many years.

Wisconsin is progressive in many important matters--we cannot allow these innocent animals to suffer in inhumane conditions.  I ask you to please consider an independent investigation of Ridglan Farms.

Sincerely,
Sabrina Gentile
