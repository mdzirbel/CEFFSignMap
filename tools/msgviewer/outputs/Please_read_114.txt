District Attorney Ozanne,

I will keep this short and to the point.   Ridglan Farms is a BLIGHT on our state.  It is 2024 and animals should not be bred for brutal experiments.  My goodness….this is not 1945…

They do many things that are morally and ethically and more important ILLEGALLY WRONG.  I do not need to list them, everyone knows.

Please prosecute Ridglan farms and close this horrible business.

Thank you
