District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I believe that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be stopped. Over decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Each moment you allow this abuse to continue unchecked, you allow these dogs to suffer unimaginable cruelty.


I believe it is your job to do everything in your power to defend those who can’t defend themselves—including the animals in your district who need someone in your position to fight for them. I hope you will stand with the animal rescuers who have put their own safety and futures on the line to save lives. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Casey Mysliwy
