Dear Ms. Ozanne:

I am concerned over the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  I want to ask you to take action in prosecuting the abuse of thousands of dogs taking place at this facility.

I would appreciate your reply as soon as possible.

Thank you.

Elizabeth Cornell
