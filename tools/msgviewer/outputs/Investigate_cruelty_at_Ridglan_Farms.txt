I have read about and seen disturbing footage of the hundreds of beagles bred at Ridglan Farms: dogs in small wire cages, untreated injuries, no exercise, no stimulation, overpowering stench of feces and urine....Guessing that dog lovers would agree that is no way they treat their own dogs...and would agree it's abject cruelty.

I realize that the DA dropped the case so that the defendants could not present, in their testimony, the wicked treatment of these dogs and the horrific experiments and death awaiting them at such corporations as Pfizer.  There would be public outcry.

It's past time that Wisconsin investigate the cruelty at Ridglan and prosecute the real villains in this case - the people who make huge profits off the suffering of thousands of beagles who are born in misery and die horrible deaths.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
