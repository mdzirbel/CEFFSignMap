Dear Sir,
I live in Michigan where we highly respect our dogs. Itâ€™s beyond my comprehension that Wisconsin would allow such heinous behavior to exist in the state. Please Sir do everything in your power to pass legislation outlawing such contemptible treatment of dogs. Put these people out of business and rescue these suffering animals from such horrific living conditions. No animal deserves to be treated like this. Give these dogs the respect they deserve and a life of dignity.
Thank you for your time.
Sincerely, Roxanne M Laurence
