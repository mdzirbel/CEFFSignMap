Hello
 Iâ€™m writing to voice my concerns over the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  I want to ask District Attorney Ismael Ozanne to take action in prosecuting the abuse of thousands of dogs taking place at this facility.


 Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.
