Hello,

Ridglan Farms (RF) has been reported for criminal animal abuse multiple times.

Not only is the establishment experimenting on beagles, an animal that is conventionally domesticated and protected by anti-animal abuse laws, but Ridglan Farms is also physically abusing the beagles through actions such as mutilation of infected areas of their bodies. The beagles are catching infections because 1.) they are being warehoused in small cages with neglect concerning their untenable living conditions, and 2.) they're being experimented on.

I became aware of this information because of Wayne Hsiung, an animal rights lawyer who has legally conflicted with RF but the company backed out of a lawsuit because they were afraid that the arguments he planned to use in court would lead to their own undoing.

Wayne posts on the social media website X footage of the abuse committed by RF, and he has interviewed a whistleblower (a former employee) regarding the alleged abuse ranging as far as mutilation by an individual who was NOT a certified veterinarian.

To my understanding, the State of Wisconsin has a law that allows the investigation of animal abuse of private residences without a warrant for the animal's safety as a protected person. When what would typically be a violation of civil liberties is implemented becomes legally justifiable for the protection of animals, my question is follows:

Why has Ridglan Farms been getting away with abusing animals that are, for many people, pets protected by animal abuse laws, for so long? Why they
