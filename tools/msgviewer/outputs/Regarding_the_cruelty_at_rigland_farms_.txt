I’m writing to you regarding the horrific cruelty that’s going on at Rigland farms.  Something needs to be done here and this place needs to be shut down ASAP.
These Beagles have been beaten to death. I’ve seen what’s going on there,  and they’ve been tortured and it is  disgusting the way these innocent animals have been treated. as a judge or a district attorney  You  cannot turn your back. Something has to be done here and this place needs to be shut down ASAP. it breaks my heart to see that such a thing is going on at this place and we as animal lovers and people that have compassion should shut this place down immediately.
Please act on this now.
Roshi.
