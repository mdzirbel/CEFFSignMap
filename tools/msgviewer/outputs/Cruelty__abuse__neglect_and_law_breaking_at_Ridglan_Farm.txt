District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing to you regarding criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County that needs to be addressed and stopped. For many years, the company has bred dogs for brutal experiments. During this time, Ridglan has been violating state animal cruelty laws, such as (to name a few):


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


It seems barbaric and corrupt that Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted people that have tried to rescue some of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Yours sincerely
