Dear Dane County DA,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a troubling matter regarding animal welfare violations that have been documented by investigators, including the USDA's own inspectors.

It has come to light that despite the clear evidence of violations of animal welfare laws, District Attorney Ismael Ozanne has chosen to prosecute beagle rescuers rather than address the issue of criminal animal cruelty. The documented conditions include instances of surgical mutilation without proper anesthesia or veterinary oversight, cruel confinement in tiny metal cages leading to psychological torment, and improper wire flooring causing injuries and infections to the dogs.

These abuses have been ongoing for several years, with no visible efforts to rectify the situation, as recent as December 2023. It is deeply concerning that such inhumane treatment of animals continues unchecked.

I urge you to consider taking appropriate action to address these egregious violations and ensure the protection and well-being of these innocent animals.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you require any further information.

Best regards,
Jessica
