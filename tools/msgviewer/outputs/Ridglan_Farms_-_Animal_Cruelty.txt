District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have been made aware of the criminal animal abuse taking place at Ridglan Farms in Dane County; it must be addressed, stopped and the offenders prosecuted. Over many decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:



  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present (example:  removal of the cherry eye gland without anesthesia).
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs.
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

Individuals are prosecuted for these very actions and in no way should a company or corporation be immune to animal cruelty laws.  Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to continue to endure criminal abuse. Its long past time to fully investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms.  Wouldnâ€™t you seek justice if your own dog or other animal was treated so brutally?

Respectfully,

Lisa Vializ
