Hi,

My name is Madelyn Bingham, I am asking District Attorney Ismael Ozanne to prosecute Ridglan Farms for animal cruelty. The press I have seen recently has been incredibly disturbing. Veterinarians and inspectors as recent as December 2023 have noted abnormal behavior in their beagles, as well as puppies not being able to walk or stand correctly due to improper flooring or their cages. I am urgently asking you to prosecute them for this abuse and negligence. These dogs are sentient being that can suffer greatly physically and emotionally and deserve more than they are getting. Please donâ€™t let down your constituents with this case and hold Ridglan Farms accountable. This will set a precedent that we as a county care for our animal companions and their wellbeing.

Thank you for your time,
Madelyn Bingham
