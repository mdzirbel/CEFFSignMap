District District Attorney Dane Coda,


I am writing to you and have sent an e-mail to Attorney Ismael Ozanne as well-because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies



It is completely inhumane and immoral to allow for Any company to continue to violate laws that are in place for good reason-far too many violations-especially when it comes to Animals, are ignored-many laws are inadequate and too vague or weak to truly help those who are exploited, against their will-deprived of every natural behavior or instinct-denied any social interaction or any sense of family-Animals who feel every emotion that We do and have the right to live autonomous lives away from the greed, indifference, cruelty of “men”.
If some People think that corporations are People, that a river can be a person-rights of nature-than clearly Animals should be given this status as well-since again-they are NOT “things”-NOT inanimate and clearly many are cognitive, intelligent, social and again possess EVERY emotion We do!
I need to also add that My Beliefs in a Loving, Caring GOD Creator enforce this ethos-it is obvious that Animals are sensitive, experience pain, fear, love-This is especially true for the Animals We have decided to bring into our homes, who become part of the family as companion Animals.
I am sure You are well aware of cases regarding Chimpanzees, Orangutans, Gorillas, along with Dolphins and currently there have been cases for several Elephants-Happy in particular languishing in the Bronx Zoo-Thousands of People are fighting for Her case-and others that will Finally FREE them to Sanctuaries.
What Ridglan does to sweet, loyal, trusting Beagles is vile, repulsive and a betrayal-NO civilized society should allow, tolerate or support this treatment-it IS barbaric, sadistic and actually DOES NOT help Humans!
It is a WASTE of TAX money-MY money-goes against my morals, values and does NOT align with my lifestyle OR My Beliefs!
Since over 95% of all tests done on Animals fail in Humans-it is TIME to END ALL research, testing and experimentation on Animals!
Many big Pharma companies No longer want to use Animals-like Pfizer, Merck and Biogen-
We are WELL into the 21st century-We can map the Human genome, create 3D printing of organs, organs on chips petri dishes, We have AI, MRI’s and In Vitro, along with low dose testing and clinic trials and ALL the patient data in databases-also computer simulated programs and mannequins.
It is TIME to CLOSE DOWN these vile facilities of torture and suffering! This facilities actually increase the threats of more viruses and diseases spreading to Humans-Since these Beagles are so compromised, stressed and denied any proper care-they suffer from many infections, live in their own blood, pus, urine, feces-their immune systems are weakened and they succumb to sickness and disease-
By now We should know that any facility that houses large numbers of Animals crowded together are cesspools of diseases-whether they are labs or factory “farms”, “fur farms”, etc-these very facilities were hot spots for Covid, Avian flu, MRSA, SARS and many other deadly virus’s!!!
Science should be Humane and actually benefit HUMANS!!!
Human Relevant methods should be used-NOT Animals!
I support The FDA Modernization Act 2.0 that Congress passed and The FDA Modernization Act 3.0-it is TIME that THESE laws were enforced!!!!


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue. I am sure that IF YOU went to this facility-UN announced for a tour-YOU would be compelled to rescue as many dogs as You could!!!

Compassion, Mercy, Caring, and Empathy should NEVER be punished!!! Cruelty, violence and senseless murder should!!!! There is NO “sugar coating” what these psychos do to Animals and NO excuse or justification in the 21st Century-

Ridglan needs to adapt, adjust to the CHANGING times and use State of the Art, NON-Animal methods ONLY!!!!!


Respectfully,


Lisa Scharin
