Hello,
According to a post I read, this “Riddled Farms” is a dog factory farm in Wisconsin, and the 2nd largest dog factory farm that sends thousands of sweet beagles for medical experimentation for cruel experimentation. If this is true this is not ok. Animals are the most innocent and pure beings on the planet and should never suffer at the hands of humans or even for the benefit of humans.

Help the whistleblowers facing prison time for exposing factory farm abuses and rescuing suffering animals



Can you please investigate and prosecute this farm accordingly?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
