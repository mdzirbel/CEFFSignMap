District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


This has been exposed to the public by brave rescuers who have been willing to sacrifice their freedom to save these dogs.  However, instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses you have prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs, thereby allowing thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan Farms for these horrific crimes, not animal rescuers.


Respectfully,

Rebecca Bodey
