Good morning,

I am reaching out to voice my concerns about the significant evidence regarding criminal animal cruelty occurring at Rigdlan Farms, and the lack of prosecution up to this point.

Please consider pursuing justice in this case. When I notice people are apathetic or turning a blind eye to the blatant torture of captive animals, it makes me wonder what sort of abuse or mistreatment such an individual has learned to accept in their own life toward their own person.

It is a signal of our humanity to see the unnecessary torture of another sentient being and to feel moved to act. Our humanity is a gift, and it is a strength to care for the most vulnerable among us.

If you have a dog of your own, or if you have ever known a dog that you loved, please consider how you would feel to see that dog trapped in a cage its entire life, only to be force fed caustic chemicals or be surgically mutilated without anesthesia.

There are laws in place to protect animals from this type of treatment. But laws are only effective if they are upheld.

I know this is a difficult matter to face, but it's an important one. The way we treat and care for others is a reflection of the way we treat and care for ourselves.

I don't have to know you personally to know that you deserve care, compassion, love, and to be defended against abusive captivity. I hope you believe that about yourself as well.

Thank you for reading, and hopefully for being part of the movement toward treating animals with the respect and dignity we all want for ourselves.

Sincerely,
Fay Rae
