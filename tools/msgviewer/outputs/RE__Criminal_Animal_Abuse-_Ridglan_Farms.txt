District Attorney Ozanne,
I am writing because I have serious concerns that animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped!  Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments.  During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, including:
* Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
* Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological; trauma for the dogs
* Improper flooring and housing, causing painful foot injuries and infections in puppies

BUT, instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these terrible offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs!  Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal animal abuse!  Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescue!

Sincerely,
- Lenora Dernoga
