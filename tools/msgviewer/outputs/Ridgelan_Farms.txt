I am writing concerning criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


You did not prosecute Ridglan for these offenses, you have prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Sincerely,
Jennifer Nitz
