To whom it may concern,

I have been following the Ridglan Farm rescue situation.

The case against the activists has been dismissed which actually means Ridglan Farm is guilty of animal abuse.

Action must be taken. I have looked at their website and they are stating Class A and have the highest standards of health for the animals.

This case has been a huge waste of tax payers money and yet Ridglan is at fault.

You have a responsibility here.
