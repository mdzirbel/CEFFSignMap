District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Beagles and so many animals are subjected to the most horrific experiments proven in so many cases to be misleading for humans. I am positive that in the times we live right now there are always alternatives so that animals don't have to suffer. We just need to want to open our eyes to the dark world of laboratory experiments and have compasion for all livings.


I hope you find it in your heart to have compasion for all these innocent souls that suffer in vain.


Respectfully,


Ecaterina Cazacu
