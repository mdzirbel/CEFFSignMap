District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing about the very sad and cruel criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms dog breeders in Dane County.


Ridglan has been caught m violating state animal cruelty laws which isolate, mutilate, confine, scare, and hurt these poor puppies! All for abolutely no good reason, so why protect these local companies and ignore real suffering with documentation?

Thank you for fighting cruelty,
