District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I am horrified at the horrific animal abuse that had transpired at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. That must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. These are sentient beings who feel pain and terror just as much as you and I. The tide is turning and soon we will look back on such practices as totally barbarian and unnecessary. Please be at the forefront of this movement. Show compassion. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Danielle Hart
