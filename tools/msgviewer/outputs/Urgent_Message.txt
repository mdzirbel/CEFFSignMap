Dear District Attorney Dane Coda,

I am reaching out with deep concerns regarding ongoing criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms within Dane County, which demands immediate attention and action. For many years, this establishment has been involved in breeding dogs for harsh experiments, during which numerous violations of state animal cruelty statutes have been reported. These violations include:

- Performing surgical procedures on dogs without any anesthesia or the presence of qualified veterinarians, causing unnecessary pain and suffering.
- Keeping dogs in small metal cages, often alone, which leads to significant psychological distress and trauma.
- Using inadequate flooring and living conditions that lead to injuries and infections among the puppies.

Regrettably, instead of holding Ridglan Farms accountable for these egregious acts, actions have been taken against those who have stepped in to rescue these animals. It is imperative that we protect the thousands of dogs in our county from such blatant abuse. I urge you to prosecute Ridglan Farms for their offenses rather than penalizing those who are attempting to help these animals.

Sincerely,

Alex Rocha
