Good Evening District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I believe that the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be acknowledged and stopped. For many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for cruel experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating many state animal cruelty laws.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these unlawful acts, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these poor dogs. Please, don’t allow thousands of your county’s dogs to experience illegal abuse. I humbly ask you to prosecute Ridglan farms— not animal rescuers.

Thank you for your time,

Gianna “Jo” Geiler
