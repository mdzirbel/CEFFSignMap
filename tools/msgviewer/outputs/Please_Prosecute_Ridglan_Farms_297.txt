Dear DA Ozanne,

I’m an attorney, and I’m writing to respectfully urge you to prosecute criminal animal cruelty to beagle dogs taking place at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Your office has received many reports about cruelty at Ridglan over the years but has so far declined to prosecute Ridglan. In fact, your office has prosecuted rescuers who saved dogs from Ridglan, but the charges have now been dropped. That makes this a good time to prosecute the decades-long abuse at Ridglan, including:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confining dogs in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma, as evidenced by stereotypic behavior
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Please decide that your office will finally do something about this. Thousands of gentle dogs are counting on you as their only hope.


Many thanks,

Mirais Holden, Esq.
