KARMA: WHAT WE DO TO THE ANIMALS WE DO TO OURSELVES

"If I am to be a voice for the animals, how should I speak? Am I to whisper, when they are screaming in pain? Am I to be calm when they tremble in fear? Am I to shout for mercy, when their throats are being slit? Tell me how I need to speak, for you to grant them their freedom.‚Äù - Davegan Raza

"The animals are sending us a message, that they are not our food, and that we are violating laws of nature." ~ Dr. Michael Klaper

"We must not refuse to see with our eyes, what they must endure with their bodies." ~ Gretchen Wyler

"In their behavior toward creatures, all men are Nazis. Human beings see oppression vividly when they're the victims. Otherwise they victimize blindly and without a thought." ~ Isaac Bashevis Singer, author, Nobel Prize 1978

"We patronize the animals for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours, they are more finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other Nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time." ~ Henry Beston

"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." ~ Upton Sinclair
