District Attorney Ozanne,

I have just come across a video showing dogs that are being mutilated unethically and without proper care of a veterinarian.

No animal deserves abuse.


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

These rescuers spend their time to defend these innocent animals…. And yet the ones that caused the damages are not even being prosecuted makes no sense.

I’m sure if this was one of your own pets you would be equally if not more mortified of someone harming your pet.


Ridglan farms should have QUALIFYING veterinarians looking after these dogs to provide proper care NOT torturing them.


Please take this seriously, only YOU have the means to change it for the better.


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

Maria Alonso
