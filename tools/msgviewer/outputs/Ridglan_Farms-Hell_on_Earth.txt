District Attorney Ozane,

I am writing because I have major concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped immediately. Over many decades, the company has been breeding these innocent, defenseless dogs specifically for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating several state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

This situation sounds like pure hell on earth for these sentient, gentle animals who are diabolically chosen specifically because of their docile and forgiving nature.
As a civilised society that supposedly values empathy, compassion, justice and just basic decency we simply cannot allow this horror to continue.

Shockingly, instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these vile offenses, you have prosecuted the courageous rescuers of these dogs.Please do the right thing and put compassion and human decency above powerful corporate greed. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to continue to endure endless suffering and criminal abuse. Stand up for the voiceless, uphold the law, and prosecute Ridglan farms not animal rescue. The world is watching.

Respectfully,

Jessica Gaves
