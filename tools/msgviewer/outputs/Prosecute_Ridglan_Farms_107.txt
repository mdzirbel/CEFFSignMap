Good evening,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   • Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present (absolutely horrible!)
  *
  *   • Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs (also horrible)
  *
  *   • Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies (if I didn’t make it clear enough, this is just as horrible, too)

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Kind regards,
Myrtena Gonzalez
