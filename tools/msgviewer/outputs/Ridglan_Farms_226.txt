District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have heard that severe animal abuse is occurring at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, and that rather than prosecuting this “farm” you have attempted to bring a case against people of good conscience who tried to save some of these dogs from this torture. It utterly astonishes me that it is still possible in this country to use animals as test subjects in experiments that cause pain and distress and may end in them being sacrificed. And that it is lawful to raise dogs in conditions that cause permanent harm such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Please don’t let Dane County be known as a place that allows thousands of dogs to endure abuse. I ask that you investigate the conditions at Ridglan Farms and do whatever is necessary to end this practice immediately.


Respectfully,

Leah Redwood
