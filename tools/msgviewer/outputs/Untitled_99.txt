District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,

                        Reva




P.S. if this was human babies would you still allow it because to me it's the same thing those dogs are living breathing creatures just like us we are all God's creation and don't think this company wouldn't do the same to a human if they could get by with murder because if their that heartless to do to dogs they'd definitely do it to a human maybe someone should further investigate because I bet dogs or other animals aren't the only ones being tested there either restricted area or basement I bet you'll find babies children and adults also being used as lab rats
