Government Officials:

I’ve been opposing vivisection for decades. And I’m now asking you to do the same. Or, at the very least do your job and investigate and prosecute Ridglan Farms for violation of the state animal cruelty laws that already exist.

Dogs and humans are different anatomically, physiologically, histologically, immunologically, etc. Because of this fact experimenting on dogs and expecting something useful to come out of it for human health is insanity. Much the same insanity as if one were to expect to shed light on canine ailments by experimenting on humans!

Not only Ridglan is wasting tax dollar monies, but they are brutalizing innocent beings. I am sure you wouldn’t allow anyone to treat your dog in the manner. So why are you not taking action to prosecute Ridglan for the violations of animal cruelty laws of your state?

Enough is enough. Take action against Ridglan and hold them accountable.
