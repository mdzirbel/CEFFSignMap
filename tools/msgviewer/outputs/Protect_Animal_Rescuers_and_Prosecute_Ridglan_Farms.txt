Dear Officials,

We have grave concerns about criminal animal abuse taking place at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.  These atrocities must be addressed and stopped. Over decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms and protect those brave souls involved in animal rescue.


Sincerely,

Mr. & Mrs. David (Debra) Ashton

Montville, New Jersey
