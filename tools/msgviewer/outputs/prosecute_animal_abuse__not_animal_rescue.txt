I am writing about criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane
County.

The company has been breeding dogs for cruel experiments, violating
state animal cruelty laws, such as:

*  Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
*  Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement,
leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
*  Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections
in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead
prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Thousands more dogs in your
county will endure criminal abuse if you don't prosecute Ridglan farms.

Respectfully,
Kari Olsen
