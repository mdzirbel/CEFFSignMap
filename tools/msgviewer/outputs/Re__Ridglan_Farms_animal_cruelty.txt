District Attorney Ozanne,


I'm writing to inquire about any intentions you have about prosecuting Ridglan Farms in Dane County for what amounts to criminal animal abuse. It has come to light that, over decades, the company has been breeding dogs for torturous experiments. Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, by:


  *   Conducting surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confining dogs in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Implementing improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to continue enduring such criminal abuse. Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have chosen to instead prosecute the rescuers of these dogs. Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Gonzalo Arteaga
