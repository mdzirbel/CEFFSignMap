District Attornry Ozanne,

I urge you to investigate and prosecute Ridglan to the full extent of the law for reported  violation  of animal cruelty laws.

Among the concerns are :

Surgical procedures without anesthetics

Confinement in small metal cages and isolation cause it psychological trauma

Infections and foot injuries to puppies due to poor living conditions

Rather than prosecuting the perpetrators of animal cruelty, you have prosecuted those who had the compassion to rescue suffering dogs.

Please do the right thing and follow up on this issue.

Thank you, Wendy Hollis

Agawam, Mass.
