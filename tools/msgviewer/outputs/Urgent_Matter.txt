Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I am reaching out to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, an issue that demands immediate legal intervention. For several decades, this establishment has been implicated in the breeding of dogs for experiments characterized by inhumane practices. It has come to light that Ridglan Farms has repeatedly violated state animal cruelty statutes through actions that include:


- Performing surgical mutilations on dogs without the use of anesthetics or the supervision of qualified veterinarians.

- Subjecting animals to confinement in small, metal cages for prolonged periods, often in isolation, which results in severe psychological distress.

- Maintaining inadequate flooring and housing conditions, leading directly to foot injuries and infections among the puppies.


Despite these clear violations, it has been noted with concern that legal action has predominantly targeted individuals attempting to rescue these dogs, rather than prosecuting the entity responsible for their suffering. This approach not only undermines efforts to protect vulnerable animals but also permits the perpetuation of cruelty under your jurisdiction.


I urge you to reconsider the stance taken on this matter and to prioritize the prosecution of Ridglan Farms for its continued illegal and unethical treatment of animals. It is crucial that we take a stand against such injustices to prevent the needless suffering of thousands of dogs within Dane County.


I look forward to seeing meaningful action taken against Ridglan Farms and am hopeful for a future where the rights and well-being of animals are fully protected under the law.


Respectfully,

Heith Mahfoudhi
