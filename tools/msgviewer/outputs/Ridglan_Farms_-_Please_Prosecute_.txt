Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is occurring and must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating your states animal cruelty laws:

  1.  Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  2.  Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  3.  Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for the state law violations and offenses, you have chosen to prosecute those trying to save them. We can’t all agree that all animals deserve to be saved, but society is aligned in their adoration and love for man’s best friend. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to be more victims of criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not those trying to protect these innocent beings. Please. Save. These. Innocent. Babies. They deserve better.

Respectfully, Juli
