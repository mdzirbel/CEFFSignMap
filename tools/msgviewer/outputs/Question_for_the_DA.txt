Good morning, I wanted to know if there are any steps being taken, or that are planned to be taken, against Ridgland Farms for their ongoing treatment of animals in violation of 951.02?   Has any investigation been done by your office?

I’m curious if your office has taken the position that the treatment of the animals at Ridgeland Farms does not fit the “unnecessary and excessive pain or suffering” threshold under the statute?

Thank you for your time,

Brent
