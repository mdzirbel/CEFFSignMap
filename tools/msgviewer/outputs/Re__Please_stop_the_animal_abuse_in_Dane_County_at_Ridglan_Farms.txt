Subject: re: Please stop the animal abuse in Dane County at Ridglan Farms

Dear District Attorney Ozanne,
Ridglan Farms in Dane County has been breeding dogs for animal experimentation  for decades and have been violation state cruelty laws in the process. The dogs are kept in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement. This is psychologically traumatizing. Surgical mutilations are preformed without anesthetics and without veterinarians. There is improper flooring resulting in foot injuries.
Instead of prosecuting Ridglan, you were focused on prosecuting people that rescued dogs and exposed the abuse happening behind closed doors.
Please prosecute Ridglan Farms, not the animal rescuers.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Lynn Gallagher
