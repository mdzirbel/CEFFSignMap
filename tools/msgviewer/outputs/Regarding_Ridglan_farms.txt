Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I'm composing this email in regard to a concerning prove of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

I want to emphasize the company in question with concern, had been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During this time, Ridglan Farms has been observed for violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting the company for these offenses, you prosecute those who rescued these tortured animals for a just cause.
Please do not allow 1,000 dogs or more in your county to endure such deplorable offenses towards the true offender.

Respectfully, Daniel Jeon.
