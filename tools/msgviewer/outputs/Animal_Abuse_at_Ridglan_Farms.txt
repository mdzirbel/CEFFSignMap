District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the ongoing criminal animal abuse occurring at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It is imperative that this matter is addressed and stopped immediately. For many decades, Ridglan Farms has been involved in breeding dogs for the purpose of brutal experiments. During this time, numerous instances of violations of state animal cruelty laws have been documented, including:

- Performing surgical mutilations on dogs without the use of anesthetics or the presence of veterinarians.
- Keeping dogs confined in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, which has led to severe psychological trauma.
- Providing improper flooring and housing conditions, resulting in foot injuries and infections, particularly among puppies.

Despite these clear violations, it is disheartening to see that instead of prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these offenses, the authorities have chosen to prosecute individuals who have attempted to rescue these mistreated dogs. This situation is unacceptable. I urge you to take immediate action to stop the abuse and ensure that Ridglan Farms is held accountable for their actions. The thousands of dogs suffering in your county deserve protection and justice. Please prioritize prosecuting Ridglan Farms for their criminal activities rather than those who seek to rescue and care for these animals.

Respectfully,
Kirsten Friche
