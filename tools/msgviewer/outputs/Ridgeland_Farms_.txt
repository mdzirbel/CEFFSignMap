Hello,
As a Wisconsin resident and constituent I am thoroughly appalled and angered to know that the second largest beagle puppy mill is located here in Wisconsin, still running strong, that clear and prosecutable evidence of mistreatment and neglect has been presented, and that nothing is being done. Please hold Ridgeland Farms accountable, prosecute them, and shut them down. Animal experimentation and exploitation is unacceptable!

Sincerely,
Cynthia Samels

This puppy’s feet had NEVER touched grass until I brought her outside. She peed she was so scared. Ten minutes later she was wagging her tail, probably for the first time ever. Unacceptable!  We don’t support this behavior in Wisconsin, and neither do our animal welfare laws!
