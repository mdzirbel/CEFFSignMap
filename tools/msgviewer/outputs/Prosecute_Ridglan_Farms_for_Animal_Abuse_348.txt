District Attorney Ozanne,


Criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, Wisconsin must be prosecuted. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for mutilating experiments and during that time Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws for procedures including surgical mutilations without anesthetics, extreme confinement, and inadequate care for thousands of suffering dogs.

Animal abuse is a serious crime. It's time to step up and prosecute criminal violations of basic animal welfare laws by Rigdlan Farms. I look forward to seeing your progress in this regard.
