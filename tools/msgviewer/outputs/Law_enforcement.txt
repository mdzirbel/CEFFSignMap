District Attorney Dane Coda

I assume you are getting paid to serve the country and the law. Do your job and prosecute the people responsible for wrongdoing to animals.


The criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.


I expect your reply with which further steps you are taking in this case, to ensure the mistreatment of these animals doesn't continue.

Respectfully,


Jasmin Frahm
