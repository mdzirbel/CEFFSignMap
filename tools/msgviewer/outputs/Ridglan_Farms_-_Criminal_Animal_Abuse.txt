District Attorney Ozanne,


The days of covering up the abuse of animals in the “name of science” need to end. I am writing because I have deep concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


How in the world can you condone Ridglan Farms’ treatment of these innocent animals? With so much technology available today, there is absolutely NO NEED for animal experimentation. But, the fact that this company is allowed to continue to torture and abuse these living, breathing sentient beings is reprehensible. Instead of standing up and doing the right thing by prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Susan LoFurno
