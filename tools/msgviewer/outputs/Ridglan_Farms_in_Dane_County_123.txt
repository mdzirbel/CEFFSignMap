Good morning,


Ridglan Farms in Dane County has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

I would like to know what is being done about the animal cruelty.


Respectfully,

Tami
