Hello,

I am concerned about the rampant and criminal animal abuse that has been documented at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. Over many decades, Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for horrific and brutal experiments - during that time Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

-Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
-Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
-Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

It is extremely disturbing to me that instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have prosecuted the rescuers who have shown only kindness to these dogs. Why? Have you never loved a dog or any other innocent animal?

I adopted a rescue beagle 5 years ago - the sweetest and silliest little guy! Beagles are often “used” in animal experimentation precisely because of their sweet, docile and submissive temperaments. Please do not continue to allow thousands of beagles in your county to endure sadistic and criminal abuse: prosecute Ridglan Farms, not Animal Rescuers.

Respectfully,

Lillian Koponen
