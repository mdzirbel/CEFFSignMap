Are you planning to do anything about the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms?  Itâ€™s a breeder of beagles sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.

This is vicious.

WHAT WOULD JESUS DO??????????
