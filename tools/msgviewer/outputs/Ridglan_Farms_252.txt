District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because I have serious concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped immediately.


Over many decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal animal experiments. During that time, Ridglan Farms has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead tried to prosecute the rescuers of these dogs. Don't you think dogs deserve to be protected against horrific animal experimentation? I certainly do.


It is your job to protect the weak from those intent on doing them harm, please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.



Respectfully,


David Ramsden
