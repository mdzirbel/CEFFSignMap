Certainly, here is the revised text with the emphasized characteristics:

"Across the planet, the movement to shut down facilities that breed animals for laboratory experiments is growing. I have decided to write because I have deep concerns that the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be halted. The dogs bred by this company for experimentation endure brutalities, some are beaten, subjected to all sorts of diseases. This violence and neglect violate the principles of animal welfare. Ridglan Farms has flagrantly violated several state laws:

- Performing surgical mutilations without the presence of anesthetics or veterinarians;
- Confining animals in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to severe psychological trauma for the dogs;
- Providing improper flooring and housing, causing injuries to their feet and infections in puppies.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these violations, you have targeted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to suffer criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan Farms, not the animal rescuers.

We are in the 21st century, and various forms of laboratory testing have been developed that do not involve violence against sentient, social beings who have feelings and express them. In fact, the violence inflicted on animals in laboratories is not in line with science. It does not progress, and the response of an animal cannot be compared to that of a human being. At the very least, it is BAD (in every sense) science, involving mistreatment, deprivation, and death of animals.

Let us be rational and just!
Let us be compassionate!
Building a better world depends on our actions.
Please, do the right thing. Close down this hell called Ridglan Farms.
Thank you!
Respectfully,
Renato da Costa"
