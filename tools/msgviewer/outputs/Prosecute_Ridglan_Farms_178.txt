Hello DA of Dane County,

Please prosecute Ridglan Farms to combat their horrific practices of neglecting beagles in dirty wire cages. We need to be taking dogs into our homes to take care of them until every dog has a loving family, not breeding more into existence to be kept in dirty and lonely cages for cruel experiments.

I hope Ismael Ozanne sees my message, but if not, please forward to him. Also, please encourage him to do the right thing.

Thank you,
Alex Taylor
