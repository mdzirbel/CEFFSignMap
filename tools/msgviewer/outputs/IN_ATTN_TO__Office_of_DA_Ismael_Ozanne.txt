Dear DA Ismael Ozanne,

I have written to express my disheartenment after learning of the disturbing abuse of dogs occurring at Ridglan Farms, which has been documented through undercover investigations and by the USDA.

It concerns me that you have chosen to prosecute rescuers who helped to expose the disturbing activities occurring at this facility and help dogs in desperate need of veterinary attention, as opposed to holding this business accountable. I am deeply concerned by this unethical decision and I urge you to immediately prosecute Ridglan farms to the fullest extent of the law.

Sincerely,

Dr. Fateh Sidhu
