It is very important for District Attorney Ismael Ozanne to act on the criminal animal cruelty taking place at Ridglan Farms?  Itâ€™s a breeder of beagles sold for animal experiments. Investigations have documented instances of surgical mutilations, cruel confinement in tiny cages, dogs spinning out of stress and psychological torment, and injuries to their feet due to the metal wire they stand on all day.
Animals are not slaves they have a soul and we must protect them and treat them with kindness.
Cutting live animals to pieces never gives positive results it only is a practice of cruelty and we have enough cruelty going on in our societies. Justifying torture experiments on dogs is unacceptable and must stop now.
It is more than time to do the right thing and stop the animal torture nonsense.
