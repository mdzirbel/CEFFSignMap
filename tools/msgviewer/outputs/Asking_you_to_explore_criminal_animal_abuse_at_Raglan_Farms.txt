Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I have read with concern allegations of abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. I am writing to ask you to please investigate and address these charges. As you have no doubt heard, the company has been breeding dogs for experiments that are alleged to be inhumane. These include surgical mutilations without anesthetics. There are also numerous other issues that have been observed.

I am concerned that you seem to have been criminally pursuing folks who have been focused on the welfare of these animals. I would ask you instead to explore prosecuting Ridglan for their offenses.

Thank you for taking the time to read this email.

Best wishes,
Neil Goldberg
