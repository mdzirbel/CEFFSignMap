Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

Inside this facility, DxE investigators have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls.

PLEASE DO NOT ALLOW THIS CRUELTY TO GO UNPUNISHED! PLEASE CHARGE RIDGLAN FARMS NOW!

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Peter Wood
Maryland
