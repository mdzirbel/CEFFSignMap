Dear Sir,

Please can you stop the breeding of animals for experimentation at Ridglan? It is truly an evil place for animals, along with many others like them.

In our 21st century, no animal should be suffering at the hands of man, anywhere in the world. Experimentation on animals is very poor at finding human cures. Digital and technological means is 100% accurate. Why then, is America, a supposedly civilised country, along with other, supposedly, civilised countries not using digital methods, causing no suffering at all?

Why then, are animals suffering incarceration in hideous surroundings, being experimented upon constantly, being bred for the purposes of experimentation and living dismal lives? If sentient humans then feel and see their suffering, rescue them from hellish lives, they are arrested and dragged through the courts, only then for cases to be dropped by these horribly wealthy companies because they don't want intrusion and investigations into the cruel experiments conducted and the horrid lives animals suffer.

As human beings, we need sentience toward every animal on the planet. They're all precious and need our help and support when being exploited by humans for profit and gain. They are not ours to abuse, profit from and exploit. They deserve a good, enjoyable life, as humans do.

Lawmakers need to stop rescuers of all animals being dragged through the courts. Abusers should be, but not rescuers. In 2024 humans should be treating animals as equals shouldn't they?

Thank you for reading my email.

Yours sincerely,
S H Challenger (Mrs)
