District Attorney Coda,


I hope you’re well.


I am writing because I am really worried that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and ended. For decades, the company has been cruelly breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been seen to have blatantly ignored state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present (unthinkable)

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

With respect, it deeply saddens me that Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, it seems you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs, who honestly are just showing a strong understanding of virtue ethics. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure more criminal abuse. I don’t really understand why this is happening. Please, Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully with very best wishes,

Bronwen
