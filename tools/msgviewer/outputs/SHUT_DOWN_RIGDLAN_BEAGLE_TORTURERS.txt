I just read an email regarding one of the last remaining Beagle factory farms in the U.S. and frankly I was completely appalled and thoroughly disgusted, and very saddened.  How is it possible in this day and age that the people and the state of Wisconsin are still allowing this cruel midevil torture of man's best friend - - and one of the cutest and sweetest dog breeds on the planet

I am a former Beagle owner. I had my Beagle from the age of 8 weeks to when I had to put him to sleep at 16 years old due to congestive heart failure and I am, again, saddened and appalled that you are letting the torture of these dogs happen for years now!  Labs are finally being shut down that have tortured animals, Beagles being the top dog in their torture because of their calm, sweet and gentle nature.  IT IS SO SAD YOU ARE ALLOWING THE CONTINUED TORTURE OF THESE BEAGLES IN THAT HORRIBLE PLACE'S FACTORY FARM.  What is wrong with the District Attorney and the Prosecutors in your state?  Are they being paid off perhaps by this factory torture farm? I mean, what is going on there?  Its unconscionable!  I've got to tell you, I don't know of any other reason that could make the continuous torture of animals go on - - unless you all just hate animals and want to see sweet little Beagles be tortured and keep them SUFFER!ING EVERY SINGLE DAY YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR!

Animal rights activists have been outside your offices and yet, you dropped the charges on 3 people who investigated Rigdlan but that only allowed for the continued "coverup" of what's going on there. i read that the charges were dropped against the animal advocates way back in 2017!  So that means that you people  have done NOTHING for these poor suffering dogs since then and that's 8 YEARS!!!  SO HOW LONG HAS THIS PLACE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE TORTURING ANIMALS?  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR - - THIS IS HAPPENING ON YOUR WATCH YEAR AFTER YEAR!  So, is it that you ARE being paid off or are you animal haters and enjoy going to sleep at night knowing how all of those dogs continue to suffer every single day ofr their poor sad lives? Which is it?

Investigators have documented dogs crammed into small cages, often alone, with no access to the outdoors; noxious air and feces building up beneath the cages; dogs with red and swollen feet from standing on wire cage floors; and dogs showing signs of extreme psychological torment like spinning endlessly in circles and bouncing off the cage walls.

THE DOGS ARE NOT ONLY SUFFERING PHYSICALLY, THEY ARE EXTREMELY SUFFERING EMOTIONALLY!  When an animal spins around in a small cage round and round and round, bouncing off the walls of that small cage - - THAT IS EXTREME EXTREME CRUELTY!

WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?  YOU HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THIS BUT YOU DO NOTHING!  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!

END THIS TORTURE NOW - - NOT NEXT YEAR OR 2 OR 3 OR 6 YEARS FROM NOW - - END IT NOW!  ITS JUST UNBELEIVEABLE YOU ARE LETTING THIS GO ON WHEN YOU HAVE THE POWER TO STOP IT.  PLEASE BE A DECENT HUMAN BEING AND STOP THIS TORTURE AND ABUSE FROM INNOCENT ANIMALS THAT HAVE DONE NOTHING TO ANYBODY.  The state of WI needs to take these dogs out of their torture chambers, take them all to a vet, and eventually find them homes!  THAT'S IT, THAT'S YOUR JOB!  STOP BEING DISPICABLE HUMANS AND DO YOUR DAMN JOB!
