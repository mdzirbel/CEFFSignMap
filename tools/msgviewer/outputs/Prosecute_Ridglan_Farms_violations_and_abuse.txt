Hi,


I am writing because I have grave concerns that criminal animal abuse is being ignored in Dane County, specifically at Ridglan Farms. I learned that your office has prosecuted the rescuers of beagles from that abusive dog factory farm, but has done nothing about the abuse taking place at Ridglan Farms itself. What Ridglan does is on par with animal abuse in the notorious Yulin Festival in China. Dogs are confined in tiny cages with wire flooring which hurts their paws, mutilated and barely kept alive only to “look forward to” excruciating experiments that I can only call sadistic, and further mutilations, vivisection and eventual murder. Any such action by an individual would absolutely constitute animal cruelty. And yet it is allowed to happen on the US soil and on a huge scale. The USDA’s own inspectors have documented conditions that constitute violations of animal welfare laws. Why is the DA doing nothing about it and allowing this to continue to happen? You could be a hero for millions of Americans who are vehemently against cruelty to dogs and yet you are choosing to defend a heartless corporation. Most Americans are disgusted by the idea of hurting dogs. How is this OK with you?

Please prosecute the true villain here - Ridglan Farms.
