Subject: Ridglan Farms in Dane County


District Attorney Ozanne,


My reason for writing is that I am genuinely concerned that allegations of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County have been made that must be addressed and stopped.


The company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments over many years.   During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present;

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs;

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.


I believe that Ridglan should be prosecuted for these allegations, if proved.


The general public cannot bear the thought of animal abuse and suffering to be ongoing at all.  Animal experimentation is being challenged owing to its failure to show efficacy and there are now better non-animal ways.  Please therefore, if there is animal abuse occurring at Ridglan, can you use your power and prosecute?  The rescuers are acting according to their consciences and are morally, good people and should never be prosecuted for that.


Yours sincerely,



Eileen Gibson
