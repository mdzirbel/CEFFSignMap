 To : District Attorney Ismael Ozanne,
Please investigate, publicly expose and prosecute Ridglan Farms for their torture and mutilation of Beagles. Would you give them your dog or child to  “experiment on?” Please think about why or why not.
Animal experimentation is useless, archaic and barbaric. The mental and physical suffering of innocent dogs at Ridglan Farms is an egregious atrocity, comparable in every aspect to the Holocaust. Please help end the Holocaust against animals by prosecuting the perpetrators at Ridglan Farms. Be certain to rid your county of this horrific, morally deranged death camp.
Thank You,
Bonnie C.
