Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I am very concerned about the criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County, which must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has consistently violated Wisconsin animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.


Please prosecute Ridglan Farms rather than going after activists who have the well being of animals at heart.


Respectfully,


Jennifer Ferrarese
