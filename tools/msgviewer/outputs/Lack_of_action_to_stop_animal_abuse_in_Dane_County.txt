Dear District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing from the UK because I am shocked that animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County has been allowed to take place.


It seems animal welfare inspectors have been doing nothing to stop the abuse. The inspectors must have witnessed over many decades, that Ridglan Farms has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, it seems Ridglan has been observed by their own staff and others violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anaesthetics or veterinarians present.
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs.
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan Farms for these offences, Dane County has prosecuted the rescuers of some of these dogs. The rescuers clearly applied compassionate morality to save imprisoned, vulnerable dogs in the absence of action by the Authorities.


Please do not let down humane citizens in Dane County or those watching around the world. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescuers.


Respectfully,


Chess Wood
