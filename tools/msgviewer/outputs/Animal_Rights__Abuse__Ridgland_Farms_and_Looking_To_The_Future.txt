Good afternoon Attorney Ozanne,


The following is a template email that exercises the thoughts of many, however I would seek to add that both the use and keeping of animals for any experimentation - medical or otherwise - is both against the rights of other living beings, cruel beyond measure and, with the advent of new technologies, now fundamentally unnecessary. Please look to the future, hold those culpable of malpractice to account and advocate in the strongest possible terms for a future free of animals testing and torture.


Thank you.


Further,


I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Henry Newbury
