District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that there is criminal animal abuse happening at Ridglan Farms in Dane County and the people think this must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:

  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present including mutilation of vocal cords of a beagle because he wouldn’t stop howling.
  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs which causes them to do things such as circle endlessly.
  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted a rescuers of some of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Please, prosecute Ridglan farms, don’t prosecute against an animal rescue organization that just wants these creatures to live a normal doggy life.

Respectfully,

Charles Pate
