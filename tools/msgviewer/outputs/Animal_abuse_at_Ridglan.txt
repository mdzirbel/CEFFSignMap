Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing in response to the animal cruelty footage I have seen at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

I am asking your office to do the will of the people and address and stop this with your power.

People do not want this ignored and what you do now will show the character of your office and the level of your compassion.

Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws many times:
● Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
● Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological
trauma for the dogs
● Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies
Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs.

Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse.
Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Respectfully,
Ellen Svehla
Chicago IL
