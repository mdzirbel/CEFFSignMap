District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing to you because proven criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped immediately. Over many decades, this company has been breeding dogs for brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, such as:


Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present
Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs
Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies

This is not only illegal but also a totally unacceptable and needless practice within today's society where it is fully recognised that alternative methods, other than animal experimentation, produce far more reliable results and are now widely used.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,

Tessa Shellby
