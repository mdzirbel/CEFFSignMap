Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I hope you're having a good day. I'm reaching out to you about the horrific, criminal animal abuse happening right now at Ridglan Farms in Dane County. It is unacceptable and it must be stopped.

Be on the right side of history! Just in 2022 another horrific beagle factory farms, Envigo, was shut down by the federal government due to the atrocious animal cruelty happening there. Ridglan Farms is the exact same!

This incredibly cruel and unnecessary company has been forcibly impregnating, breeding into existence sweet innocent beagles in the most horrific conditions of confinement, deprivation, filth and unimaginable psychological and physical torment.

Please do not continue to allow thousands of innocent puppies and dogs in your county to endure criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue!!


Respectfully,

Kitty Jones
