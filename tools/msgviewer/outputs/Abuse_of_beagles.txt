Dane County District Attorney's Office,

As a child, I grew up with a beagle we had at home. Our dog was a wonderful being who taught me about love and affection. With that in mind, I am deeply saddened to learn of the animal abuse occurring at Ridglan Farms. This abuse includes surgery without anesthesia and housing these highly social creatures in solitary wire cages. This must stop. Please use the power of your office to prosecute those abusing animals rather than those rescuing animals.

With respect,
Nakul Vyas
