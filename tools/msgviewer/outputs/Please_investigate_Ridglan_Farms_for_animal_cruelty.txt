Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

I am a Milwaukee, Wisconsin resident and former legislative aide to congressman Jim Moody. I am very concerned about the conditions and animal cruelty witnessed at the beagle factory farm, Ridglan Farms near Madison, WI. And in light of the newest information regarding animal, cruelty there, I urge your office to investigate this business.

Many people will be working to pass legislation in the state of Wisconsin to ban medical experimentation on dogs outright. In the interim, investigating this business, their practices and the cruelty that exists is going to be a very important step, and we do not take it lightly. Of course, animals cannot speak on their own behalf, and they have no political ties making them especially more vulnerable.

HopeI hope your office will take these allegations seriously and investigate as soon as possible. I am copying my Congresswoman, Gwen Moore on this communication.

Many thanks for your work,

Lisa Castagnozzi
