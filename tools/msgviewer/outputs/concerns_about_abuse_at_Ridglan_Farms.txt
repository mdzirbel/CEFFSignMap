Dear District Attorney Ozanne,

As a Bay Area college student with aspirations to become a veterinarian, and a dedicated volunteer at my local animal shelter, I am deeply troubled by the ongoing reports of animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County.

The violations of state animal cruelty laws, including surgical procedures without proper anesthetics, confinement in small cages causing psychological trauma, and inadequate housing leading to injupries and infections, are deeply concerning to me.

I am committed to advocating for every animal that is being abused, and I urge you to prioritize the well-being of these innocent animals by taking decisive action against Ridglan Farms. It is disheartening to hear that rescuers are being prosecuted instead of the perpetrators. Please reconsider this approach and support the efforts of those who are working tirelessly to rescue and care for these mistreated animals.

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. I trust that you will do what is right for the voiceless animals who rely on our protection.

Sincerely,

Angelina Harris
