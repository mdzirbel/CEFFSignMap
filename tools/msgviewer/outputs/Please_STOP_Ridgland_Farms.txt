District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing to you today with a heavy heart, compelled by a deep sense of compassion and a firm belief in justice for all living beings.

The revelations of criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County have shaken me to my core. For far too long, this company has operated with impunity, subjecting innocent animals to unimaginable suffering in the name of profit and experimentation.

The accounts of surgical mutilations without proper anesthesia or veterinary care, the confinement of dogs in cramped and solitary conditions, and the neglectful housing practices leading to painful injuries and infections in vulnerable puppies are nothing short of horrifying.

What troubles me even more is the apparent lack of action from your office to hold Ridglan Farms accountable for these egregious violations of state animal cruelty laws. Instead, it is deeply troubling to learn that those who have bravely stepped forward to rescue these animals have faced prosecution themselves.

As someone who holds a profound love for animals and a steadfast commitment to doing what is right, I implore you to reconsider your approach. The moral imperative to protect the innocent and vulnerable among us, regardless of species, cannot be ignored or brushed aside.

I urge you, District Attorney Ozanne, to stand on the side of compassion and justice. Prosecute Ridglan Farms for their crimes against these voiceless creatures. Let us not allow thousands of dogs to suffer in silence any longer.

Respectfully,

Sofia Gracia
