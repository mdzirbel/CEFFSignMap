District Attorney Ozanne,

I am writing because I have concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County must be addressed and stopped. I have come to learn that, over many decades, the Ridglan Farms company has been breeding dogs for heinous, brutal experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws, including:


  *    Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present.

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs.

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies.

Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. I cannot emphasise enough how appalling and utterly unacceptable this is.Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure this horrendous criminal abuse. Prosecute Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

David MacDonald and family.
