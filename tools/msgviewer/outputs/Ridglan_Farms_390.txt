District Attorney Ozanne,


I am writing because of my concerns that criminal animal abuse at Ridglan Farms in Dane County is being glossed over and neglected. This issue must be addressed and stopped. Over many decades, the company has been breeding dogs for brutal, pointless experiments. During that time, Ridglan has been observed violating state animal cruelty laws that you should have been pursuing instead of ignoring, such as:


  *   Surgical mutilations without anesthetics or veterinarians present

  *   Confinement in small metal cages, often in solitary confinement, leading to psychological trauma for the dogs

  *   Improper flooring and housing, causing foot injuries and infections in puppies


Instead of prosecuting Ridglan for these offenses, you have instead prosecuted the rescuers of these dogs. This is clearly against public feeling, as the overwhelming attitude is that what is being done to these dogs is being viewed as outrageous cruelty and criminal abuse.


Please do not allow thousands of dogs in your county to endure this criminal abuse. You should be prosecuting Ridglan farms, not animal rescue.


Respectfully,


Arlene Steinberg & the Steinberg Family of Philadelphia, PA, and Green Bay and Milwaukee, WI
