			<h2>Privacy Policy - One Night Cardless</h2>

			<p>
				We don't store your data anywhere. We don't need it, and, quite frankly, we don't want it.
			</p>

			<p>
				The only way we'd wind up with your data is if you email it to us. Please don't do that.
			</p>

			<p>
				We know this level of apathy is unnerving to some, so we've included a form below which will ask for your important details. This form is included only for emotional support and your data will not be stored
			</p>

			<h2>A form for some reason because I am very funny and also good at writing a privacy policy and forms definitely have something to do on the privacy policy page</h2>
