				<h3>Traffic</h3>

				<p>
					Traffic is a simple JavaScript game of fast dodging that I made during High School. Gray rectangles (cars) come at you and get faster over time. Use left and right to dodge, and up and down to use the powerups. The current high score is 17.24. <a href=../Traffic/traffic.html>Click here</a> to play.
					<!-- high score is 17.24, set on local -->

				<h3>Knockout Pool</h3>

				<p>
					Knockout Pool is a JavaScript game a bit like pool, but the goal is to be the last person with balls, and you can use any of your own balls as cue balls. It's multiplayer, with layouts for two players. It's a bit unfinished and contains options for 1, 3, and 4 players which aren't implemented, and also has an occasional ball stuck in a wall glitch, which ends the game. <a href=../Pool/pool.html>Click here</a> to play.

				<h3>Space Time</h3>

				<p>
					Space Time is a JavaScript game I started and haven't gotten far on, and don't have any plans to. The concept is that you are able to move through time in the same way you typically move through space. Because of this, you can still see your previous self. It was meant to be a puzzle game, starting with a series of pressure plates you need to stand on at the same time, and moving on to some harder puzzles. <a href = "../Space Time/spaceTime.html">Click here</a> to mess around with the time aspect, although there currently aren't any puzzles. WASD to move spacially, Shift to move backward in time, and Space to move forward in time.
